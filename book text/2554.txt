\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCRIME AND PUNISHMENT\r\n\r\nBy Fyodor Dostoevsky\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranslated By Constance Garnett\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSLATOR\xe2\x80\x99S PREFACE\r\n\r\nA few words about Dostoevsky himself may help the English reader to\r\nunderstand his work.\r\n\r\nDostoevsky was the son of a doctor. His parents were very hard-working\r\nand deeply religious people, but so poor that they lived with their five\r\nchildren in only two rooms. The father and mother spent their evenings\r\nin reading aloud to their children, generally from books of a serious\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nThough always sickly and delicate Dostoevsky came out third in the\r\nfinal examination of the Petersburg school of Engineering. There he had\r\nalready begun his first work, \xe2\x80\x9cPoor Folk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis story was published by the poet Nekrassov in his review and\r\nwas received with acclamations. The shy, unknown youth found himself\r\ninstantly something of a celebrity. A brilliant and successful career\r\nseemed to open before him, but those hopes were soon dashed. In 1849 he\r\nwas arrested.\r\n\r\nThough neither by temperament nor conviction a revolutionist, Dostoevsky\r\nwas one of a little group of young men who met together to read Fourier\r\nand Proudhon. He was accused of \xe2\x80\x9ctaking part in conversations against\r\nthe censorship, of reading a letter from Byelinsky to Gogol, and of\r\nknowing of the intention to set up a printing press.\xe2\x80\x9d Under Nicholas\r\nI. (that \xe2\x80\x9cstern and just man,\xe2\x80\x9d as Maurice Baring calls him) this was\r\nenough, and he was condemned to death. After eight months\xe2\x80\x99 imprisonment\r\nhe was with twenty-one others taken out to the Semyonovsky Square to\r\nbe shot. Writing to his brother Mihail, Dostoevsky says: \xe2\x80\x9cThey snapped\r\nwords over our heads, and they made us put on the white shirts worn by\r\npersons condemned to death. Thereupon we were bound in threes to stakes,\r\nto suffer execution. Being the third in the row, I concluded I had only\r\na few minutes of life before me. I thought of you and your dear ones and\r\nI contrived to kiss Plestcheiev and Dourov, who were next to me, and to\r\nbid them farewell. Suddenly the troops beat a tattoo, we were unbound,\r\nbrought back upon the scaffold, and informed that his Majesty had spared\r\nus our lives.\xe2\x80\x9d The sentence was commuted to hard labour.\r\n\r\nOne of the prisoners, Grigoryev, went mad as soon as he was untied, and\r\nnever regained his sanity.\r\n\r\nThe intense suffering of this experience left a lasting stamp on\r\nDostoevsky\xe2\x80\x99s mind. Though his religious temper led him in the end to\r\naccept every suffering with resignation and to regard it as a blessing\r\nin his own case, he constantly recurs to the subject in his writings.\r\nHe describes the awful agony of the condemned man and insists on the\r\ncruelty of inflicting such torture. Then followed four years of penal\r\nservitude, spent in the company of common criminals in Siberia, where\r\nhe began the \xe2\x80\x9cDead House,\xe2\x80\x9d and some years of service in a disciplinary\r\nbattalion.\r\n\r\nHe had shown signs of some obscure nervous disease before his arrest\r\nand this now developed into violent attacks of epilepsy, from which he\r\nsuffered for the rest of his life. The fits occurred three or four times\r\na year and were more frequent in periods of great strain. In 1859 he was\r\nallowed to return to Russia. He started a journal--\xe2\x80\x9cVremya,\xe2\x80\x9d which was\r\nforbidden by the Censorship through a misunderstanding. In 1864 he lost\r\nhis first wife and his brother Mihail. He was in terrible poverty, yet\r\nhe took upon himself the payment of his brother\xe2\x80\x99s debts. He started\r\nanother journal--\xe2\x80\x9cThe Epoch,\xe2\x80\x9d which within a few months was also\r\nprohibited. He was weighed down by debt, his brother\xe2\x80\x99s family was\r\ndependent on him, he was forced to write at heart-breaking speed, and is\r\nsaid never to have corrected his work. The later years of his life were\r\nmuch softened by the tenderness and devotion of his second wife.\r\n\r\nIn June 1880 he made his famous speech at the unveiling of the\r\nmonument to Pushkin in Moscow and he was received with extraordinary\r\ndemonstrations of love and honour.\r\n\r\nA few months later Dostoevsky died. He was followed to the grave by a\r\nvast multitude of mourners, who \xe2\x80\x9cgave the hapless man the funeral of a\r\nking.\xe2\x80\x9d He is still probably the most widely read writer in Russia.\r\n\r\nIn the words of a Russian critic, who seeks to explain the feeling\r\ninspired by Dostoevsky: \xe2\x80\x9cHe was one of ourselves, a man of our blood and\r\nour bone, but one who has suffered and has seen so much more deeply than\r\nwe have his insight impresses us as wisdom... that wisdom of the heart\r\nwhich we seek that we may learn from it how to live. All his other\r\ngifts came to him from nature, this he won for himself and through it he\r\nbecame great.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCRIME AND PUNISHMENT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nOn an exceptionally hot evening early in July a young man came out of\r\nthe garret in which he lodged in S. Place and walked slowly, as though\r\nin hesitation, towards K. bridge.\r\n\r\nHe had successfully avoided meeting his landlady on the staircase. His\r\ngarret was under the roof of a high, five-storied house and was more\r\nlike a cupboard than a room. The landlady who provided him with garret,\r\ndinners, and attendance, lived on the floor below, and every time\r\nhe went out he was obliged to pass her kitchen, the door of which\r\ninvariably stood open. And each time he passed, the young man had a\r\nsick, frightened feeling, which made him scowl and feel ashamed. He was\r\nhopelessly in debt to his landlady, and was afraid of meeting her.\r\n\r\nThis was not because he was cowardly and abject, quite the contrary; but\r\nfor some time past he had been in an overstrained irritable condition,\r\nverging on hypochondria. He had become so completely absorbed in\r\nhimself, and isolated from his fellows that he dreaded meeting, not\r\nonly his landlady, but anyone at all. He was crushed by poverty, but the\r\nanxieties of his position had of late ceased to weigh upon him. He had\r\ngiven up attending to matters of practical importance; he had lost all\r\ndesire to do so. Nothing that any landlady could do had a real terror\r\nfor him. But to be stopped on the stairs, to be forced to listen to her\r\ntrivial, irrelevant gossip, to pestering demands for payment, threats\r\nand complaints, and to rack his brains for excuses, to prevaricate, to\r\nlie--no, rather than that, he would creep down the stairs like a cat and\r\nslip out unseen.\r\n\r\nThis evening, however, on coming out into the street, he became acutely\r\naware of his fears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to attempt a thing _like that_ and am frightened by these\r\ntrifles,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, with an odd smile. \xe2\x80\x9cHm... yes, all is in a man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhands and he lets it all slip from cowardice, that\xe2\x80\x99s an axiom. It would\r\nbe interesting to know what it is men are most afraid of. Taking a new\r\nstep, uttering a new word is what they fear most.... But I am talking\r\ntoo much. It\xe2\x80\x99s because I chatter that I do nothing. Or perhaps it is\r\nthat I chatter because I do nothing. I\xe2\x80\x99ve learned to chatter this\r\nlast month, lying for days together in my den thinking... of Jack the\r\nGiant-killer. Why am I going there now? Am I capable of _that_? Is\r\n_that_ serious? It is not serious at all. It\xe2\x80\x99s simply a fantasy to amuse\r\nmyself; a plaything! Yes, maybe it is a plaything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe heat in the street was terrible: and the airlessness, the bustle\r\nand the plaster, scaffolding, bricks, and dust all about him, and that\r\nspecial Petersburg stench, so familiar to all who are unable to get out\r\nof town in summer--all worked painfully upon the young man\xe2\x80\x99s already\r\noverwrought nerves. The insufferable stench from the pot-houses, which\r\nare particularly numerous in that part of the town, and the drunken men\r\nwhom he met continually, although it was a working day, completed\r\nthe revolting misery of the picture. An expression of the profoundest\r\ndisgust gleamed for a moment in the young man\xe2\x80\x99s refined face. He was,\r\nby the way, exceptionally handsome, above the average in height, slim,\r\nwell-built, with beautiful dark eyes and dark brown hair. Soon he sank\r\ninto deep thought, or more accurately speaking into a complete blankness\r\nof mind; he walked along not observing what was about him and not caring\r\nto observe it. From time to time, he would mutter something, from the\r\nhabit of talking to himself, to which he had just confessed. At these\r\nmoments he would become conscious that his ideas were sometimes in a\r\ntangle and that he was very weak; for two days he had scarcely tasted\r\nfood.\r\n\r\nHe was so badly dressed that even a man accustomed to shabbiness would\r\nhave been ashamed to be seen in the street in such rags. In that quarter\r\nof the town, however, scarcely any shortcoming in dress would have\r\ncreated surprise. Owing to the proximity of the Hay Market, the number\r\nof establishments of bad character, the preponderance of the trading\r\nand working class population crowded in these streets and alleys in the\r\nheart of Petersburg, types so various were to be seen in the streets\r\nthat no figure, however queer, would have caused surprise. But there was\r\nsuch accumulated bitterness and contempt in the young man\xe2\x80\x99s heart, that,\r\nin spite of all the fastidiousness of youth, he minded his rags least\r\nof all in the street. It was a different matter when he met with\r\nacquaintances or with former fellow students, whom, indeed, he disliked\r\nmeeting at any time. And yet when a drunken man who, for some unknown\r\nreason, was being taken somewhere in a huge waggon dragged by a heavy\r\ndray horse, suddenly shouted at him as he drove past: \xe2\x80\x9cHey there, German\r\nhatter\xe2\x80\x9d bawling at the top of his voice and pointing at him--the young\r\nman stopped suddenly and clutched tremulously at his hat. It was a tall\r\nround hat from Zimmerman\xe2\x80\x99s, but completely worn out, rusty with age, all\r\ntorn and bespattered, brimless and bent on one side in a most unseemly\r\nfashion. Not shame, however, but quite another feeling akin to terror\r\nhad overtaken him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew it,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered in confusion, \xe2\x80\x9cI thought so! That\xe2\x80\x99s the worst\r\nof all! Why, a stupid thing like this, the most trivial detail might\r\nspoil the whole plan. Yes, my hat is too noticeable.... It looks absurd\r\nand that makes it noticeable.... With my rags I ought to wear a cap, any\r\nsort of old pancake, but not this grotesque thing. Nobody wears such\r\na hat, it would be noticed a mile off, it would be remembered.... What\r\nmatters is that people would remember it, and that would give them\r\na clue. For this business one should be as little conspicuous as\r\npossible.... Trifles, trifles are what matter! Why, it\xe2\x80\x99s just such\r\ntrifles that always ruin everything....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had not far to go; he knew indeed how many steps it was from the gate\r\nof his lodging house: exactly seven hundred and thirty. He had counted\r\nthem once when he had been lost in dreams. At the time he had put no\r\nfaith in those dreams and was only tantalising himself by their hideous\r\nbut daring recklessness. Now, a month later, he had begun to look upon\r\nthem differently, and, in spite of the monologues in which he jeered at\r\nhis own impotence and indecision, he had involuntarily come to regard\r\nthis \xe2\x80\x9chideous\xe2\x80\x9d dream as an exploit to be attempted, although he\r\nstill did not realise this himself. He was positively going now for a\r\n\xe2\x80\x9crehearsal\xe2\x80\x9d of his project, and at every step his excitement grew more\r\nand more violent.\r\n\r\nWith a sinking heart and a nervous tremor, he went up to a huge house\r\nwhich on one side looked on to the canal, and on the other into the\r\nstreet. This house was let out in tiny tenements and was inhabited by\r\nworking people of all kinds--tailors, locksmiths, cooks, Germans of\r\nsorts, girls picking up a living as best they could, petty clerks, etc.\r\nThere was a continual coming and going through the two gates and in the\r\ntwo courtyards of the house. Three or four door-keepers were employed on\r\nthe building. The young man was very glad to meet none of them, and\r\nat once slipped unnoticed through the door on the right, and up the\r\nstaircase. It was a back staircase, dark and narrow, but he was familiar\r\nwith it already, and knew his way, and he liked all these surroundings:\r\nin such darkness even the most inquisitive eyes were not to be dreaded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I am so scared now, what would it be if it somehow came to pass that\r\nI were really going to do it?\xe2\x80\x9d he could not help asking himself as he\r\nreached the fourth storey. There his progress was barred by some porters\r\nwho were engaged in moving furniture out of a flat. He knew that the\r\nflat had been occupied by a German clerk in the civil service, and his\r\nfamily. This German was moving out then, and so the fourth floor on this\r\nstaircase would be untenanted except by the old woman. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a good\r\nthing anyway,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought to himself, as he rang the bell of the old\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s flat. The bell gave a faint tinkle as though it were made of\r\ntin and not of copper. The little flats in such houses always have bells\r\nthat ring like that. He had forgotten the note of that bell, and now\r\nits peculiar tinkle seemed to remind him of something and to bring it\r\nclearly before him.... He started, his nerves were terribly overstrained\r\nby now. In a little while, the door was opened a tiny crack: the old\r\nwoman eyed her visitor with evident distrust through the crack, and\r\nnothing could be seen but her little eyes, glittering in the darkness.\r\nBut, seeing a number of people on the landing, she grew bolder, and\r\nopened the door wide. The young man stepped into the dark entry, which\r\nwas partitioned off from the tiny kitchen. The old woman stood facing\r\nhim in silence and looking inquiringly at him. She was a diminutive,\r\nwithered up old woman of sixty, with sharp malignant eyes and a sharp\r\nlittle nose. Her colourless, somewhat grizzled hair was thickly smeared\r\nwith oil, and she wore no kerchief over it. Round her thin long neck,\r\nwhich looked like a hen\xe2\x80\x99s leg, was knotted some sort of flannel rag,\r\nand, in spite of the heat, there hung flapping on her shoulders, a mangy\r\nfur cape, yellow with age. The old woman coughed and groaned at every\r\ninstant. The young man must have looked at her with a rather peculiar\r\nexpression, for a gleam of mistrust came into her eyes again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRaskolnikov, a student, I came here a month ago,\xe2\x80\x9d the young man made\r\nhaste to mutter, with a half bow, remembering that he ought to be more\r\npolite.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI remember, my good sir, I remember quite well your coming here,\xe2\x80\x9d the\r\nold woman said distinctly, still keeping her inquiring eyes on his face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd here... I am again on the same errand,\xe2\x80\x9d Raskolnikov continued, a\r\nlittle disconcerted and surprised at the old woman\xe2\x80\x99s mistrust. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps\r\nshe is always like that though, only I did not notice it the other\r\ntime,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought with an uneasy feeling.\r\n\r\nThe old woman paused, as though hesitating; then stepped on one side,\r\nand pointing to the door of the room, she said, letting her visitor pass\r\nin front of her:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStep in, my good sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe little room into which the young man walked, with yellow paper on\r\nthe walls, geraniums and muslin curtains in the windows, was brightly\r\nlighted up at that moment by the setting sun.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo the sun will shine like this _then_ too!\xe2\x80\x9d flashed as it were by\r\nchance through Raskolnikov\xe2\x80\x99s mind, and with a rapid glance he scanned\r\neverything in the room, trying as far as possible to notice and\r\nremember its arrangement. But there was nothing special in the room. The\r\nfurniture, all very old and of yellow wood, consisted of a sofa with\r\na huge bent wooden back, an oval table in front of the sofa, a\r\ndressing-table with a looking-glass fixed on it between the windows,\r\nchairs along the walls and two or three half-penny prints in yellow\r\nframes, representing German damsels with birds in their hands--that was\r\nall. In the corner a light was burning before a small ikon. Everything\r\nwas very clean; the floor and the furniture were brightly polished;\r\neverything shone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLizaveta\xe2\x80\x99s work,\xe2\x80\x9d thought the young man. There was not a speck of dust\r\nto be seen in the whole flat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s in the houses of spiteful old widows that one finds such\r\ncleanliness,\xe2\x80\x9d Raskolnikov thought again, and he stole a curious glance\r\nat the cotton curtain over the door leading into another tiny room, in\r\nwhich stood the old woman\xe2\x80\x99s bed and chest of drawers and into which he\r\nhad never looked before. These two rooms made up the whole flat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d the old woman said severely, coming into the room\r\nand, as before, standing in front of him so as to look him straight in\r\nthe face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve brought something to pawn here,\xe2\x80\x9d and he drew out of his pocket\r\nan old-fashioned flat silver watch, on the back of which was engraved a\r\nglobe; the chain was of steel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the time is up for your last pledge. The month was up the day\r\nbefore yesterday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will bring you the interest for another month; wait a little.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut that\xe2\x80\x99s for me to do as I please, my good sir, to wait or to sell\r\nyour pledge at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow much will you give me for the watch, Alyona Ivanovna?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou come with such trifles, my good sir, it\xe2\x80\x99s scarcely worth anything.\r\nI gave you two roubles last time for your ring and one could buy it\r\nquite new at a jeweler\xe2\x80\x99s for a rouble and a half.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive me four roubles for it, I shall redeem it, it was my father\xe2\x80\x99s. I\r\nshall be getting some money soon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA rouble and a half, and interest in advance, if you like!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA rouble and a half!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the young man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease yourself\xe2\x80\x9d--and the old woman handed him back the watch. The\r\nyoung man took it, and was so angry that he was on the point of going\r\naway; but checked himself at once, remembering that there was nowhere\r\nelse he could go, and that he had had another object also in coming.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHand it over,\xe2\x80\x9d he said roughly.\r\n\r\nThe old woman fumbled in her pocket for her keys, and disappeared behind\r\nthe curtain into the other room. The young man, left standing alone in\r\nthe middle of the room, listened inquisitively, thinking. He could hear\r\nher unlocking the chest of drawers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt must be the top drawer,\xe2\x80\x9d he reflected. \xe2\x80\x9cSo she carries the keys in\r\na pocket on the right. All in one bunch on a steel ring.... And there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\none key there, three times as big as all the others, with deep notches;\r\nthat can\xe2\x80\x99t be the key of the chest of drawers... then there must be some\r\nother chest or strong-box... that\xe2\x80\x99s worth knowing. Strong-boxes always\r\nhave keys like that... but how degrading it all is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old woman came back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere, sir: as we say ten copecks the rouble a month, so I must take\r\nfifteen copecks from a rouble and a half for the month in advance. But\r\nfor the two roubles I lent you before, you owe me now twenty copecks\r\non the same reckoning in advance. That makes thirty-five copecks\r\naltogether. So I must give you a rouble and fifteen copecks for the\r\nwatch. Here it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! only a rouble and fifteen copecks now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young man did not dispute it and took the money. He looked at the\r\nold woman, and was in no hurry to get away, as though there was still\r\nsomething he wanted to say or to do, but he did not himself quite know\r\nwhat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI may be bringing you something else in a day or two, Alyona\r\nIvanovna--a valuable thing--silver--a cigarette-box, as soon as I get it\r\nback from a friend...\xe2\x80\x9d he broke off in confusion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, we will talk about it then, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye--are you always at home alone, your sister is not here with\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d He asked her as casually as possible as he went out into the\r\npassage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat business is she of yours, my good sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, nothing particular, I simply asked. You are too quick.... Good-day,\r\nAlyona Ivanovna.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRaskolnikov went out in complete confusion. This confusion became more\r\nand more intense. As he went down the stairs, he even stopped short, two\r\nor three times, as though suddenly struck by some thought. When he was\r\nin the street he cried out, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, God, how loathsome it all is! and\r\ncan I, can I possibly.... No, it\xe2\x80\x99s nonsense, it\xe2\x80\x99s rubbish!\xe2\x80\x9d he added\r\nresolutely. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd how could such an atrocious thing come into my head?\r\nWhat filthy things my heart is capable of. Yes, filthy above all,\r\ndisgusting, loathsome, loathsome!--and for a whole month I\xe2\x80\x99ve been....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n But no words, no exclamations, could express his agitation. The feeling\r\nof intense repulsion, which had begun to oppress and torture his heart\r\nwhile he was on his way to the old woman, had by now reached such a\r\npitch and had taken such a definite form that he did not know what to\r\ndo with himself to escape from his wretchedness. He walked along the\r\npavement like a drunken man, regardless of the passers-by, and jostling\r\nagainst them, and only came to his senses when he was in the next\r\nstreet. Looking round, he noticed that he was standing close to a tavern\r\nwhich was entered by steps leading from the pavement to the basement.\r\nAt that instant two drunken men came out at the door, and abusing and\r\nsupporting one another, they mounted the steps. Without stopping to\r\nthink, Raskolnikov went down the steps at once. Till that moment he had\r\nnever been into a tavern, but now he felt giddy and was tormented by a\r\nburning thirst. He longed for a drink of cold beer, and attributed his\r\nsudden weakness to the want of food. He sat down at a sticky little\r\ntable in a dark and dirty corner; ordered some beer, and eagerly drank\r\noff the first glassful. At once he felt easier; and his thoughts became\r\nclear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll that\xe2\x80\x99s nonsense,\xe2\x80\x9d he said hopefully, \xe2\x80\x9cand there is nothing in it\r\nall to worry about! It\xe2\x80\x99s simply physical derangement. Just a glass of\r\nbeer, a piece of dry bread--and in one moment the brain is stronger,\r\nthe mind is clearer and the will is firm! Phew, how utterly petty it all\r\nis!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut in spite of this scornful reflection, he was by now looking cheerful\r\nas though he were suddenly set free from a terrible burden: and he gazed\r\nround in a friendly way at the people in the room. But even at that\r\nmoment he had a dim foreboding that this happier frame of mind was also\r\nnot normal.\r\n\r\nThere were few people at the time in the tavern. Besides the two drunken\r\nmen he had met on the steps, a group consisting of about five men and\r\na girl with a concertina had gone out at the same time. Their departure\r\nleft the room quiet and rather empty. The persons still in the tavern\r\nwere a man who appeared to be an artisan, drunk, but not extremely so,\r\nsitting before a pot of beer, and his companion, a huge, stout man with\r\na grey beard, in a short full-skirted coat. He was very drunk: and had\r\ndropped asleep on the bench; every now and then, he began as though in\r\nhis sleep, cracking his fingers, with his arms wide apart and the upper\r\npart of his body bounding about on the bench, while he hummed some\r\nmeaningless refrain, trying to recall some such lines as these:\r\n\r\n   \xe2\x80\x9cHis wife a year he fondly loved\r\n    His wife a--a year he--fondly loved.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOr suddenly waking up again:\r\n\r\n   \xe2\x80\x9cWalking along the crowded row\r\n    He met the one he used to know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut no one shared his enjoyment: his silent companion looked with\r\npositive hostility and mistrust at all these manifestations. There was\r\nanother man in the room who looked somewhat like a retired government\r\nclerk. He was sitting apart, now and then sipping from his pot and\r\nlooking round at the company. He, too, appeared to be in some agitation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nRaskolnikov was not used to crowds, and, as we said before, he avoided\r\nsociety of every sort, more especially of late. But now all at once he\r\nfelt a desire to be with other people. Something new seemed to be taking\r\nplace within him, and with it he felt a sort of thirst for company. He\r\nwas so weary after a whole month of concentrated wretchedness and gloomy\r\nexcitement that he longed to rest, if only for a moment, in some other\r\nworld, whatever it might be; and, in spite of the filthiness of the\r\nsurroundings, he was glad now to stay in the tavern.\r\n\r\nThe master of the establishment was in another room, but he frequently\r\ncame down some steps into the main room, his jaunty, tarred boots with\r\nred turn-over tops coming into view each time before the rest of his\r\nperson. He wore a full coat and a horribly greasy black satin waistcoat,\r\nwith no cravat, and his whole face seemed smeared with oil like an\r\niron lock. At the counter stood a boy of about fourteen, and there was\r\nanother boy somewhat younger who handed whatever was wanted. On the\r\ncounter lay some sliced cucumber, some pieces of dried black bread, and\r\nsome fish, chopped up small, all smelling very bad. It was insufferably\r\nclose, and so heavy with the fumes of spirits that five minutes in such\r\nan atmosphere might well make a man drunk.\r\n\r\nThere are chance meetings with strangers that interest us from the\r\nfirst moment, before a word is spoken. Such was the impression made on\r\nRaskolnikov by the person sitting a little distance from him, who looked\r\nlike a retired clerk. The young man often recalled this impression\r\nafterwards, and even ascribed it to presentiment. He looked repeatedly\r\nat the clerk, partly no doubt because the latter was staring\r\npersistently at him, obviously anxious to enter into conversation. At\r\nthe other persons in the room, including the tavern-keeper, the clerk\r\nlooked as though he were used to their company, and weary of it, showing\r\na shade of condescending contempt for them as persons of station and\r\nculture inferior to his own, with whom it would be useless for him to\r\nconverse. He was a man over fifty, bald and grizzled, of medium height,\r\nand stoutly built. His face, bloated from continual drinking, was of\r\na yellow, even greenish, tinge, with swollen eyelids out of which keen\r\nreddish eyes gleamed like little chinks. But there was something very\r\nstrange in him; there was a light in his eyes as though of intense\r\nfeeling--perhaps there were even thought and intelligence, but at the\r\nsame time there was a gleam of something like madness. He was wearing an\r\nold and hopelessly ragged black dress coat, with all its buttons missing\r\nexcept one, and that one he had buttoned, evidently clinging to this\r\nlast trace of respectability. A crumpled shirt front, covered with spots\r\nand stains, protruded from his canvas waistcoat. Like a clerk, he wore\r\nno beard, nor moustache, but had been so long unshaven that his chin\r\nlooked like a stiff greyish brush. And there was something respectable\r\nand like an official about his manner too. But he was restless; he\r\nruffled up his hair and from time to time let his head drop into his\r\nhands dejectedly resting his ragged elbows on the stained and sticky\r\ntable. At last he looked straight at Raskolnikov, and said loudly and\r\nresolutely:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I venture, honoured sir, to engage you in polite conversation?\r\nForasmuch as, though your exterior would not command respect, my\r\nexperience admonishes me that you are a man of education and not\r\naccustomed to drinking. I have always respected education when in\r\nconjunction with genuine sentiments, and I am besides a titular\r\ncounsellor in rank. Marmeladov--such is my name; titular counsellor. I\r\nmake bold to inquire--have you been in the service?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I am studying,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the young man, somewhat surprised at\r\nthe grandiloquent style of the speaker and also at being so directly\r\naddressed. In spite of the momentary desire he had just been feeling for\r\ncompany of any sort, on being actually spoken to he felt immediately his\r\nhabitual irritable and uneasy aversion for any stranger who approached\r\nor attempted to approach him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA student then, or formerly a student,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the clerk. \xe2\x80\x9cJust what\r\nI thought! I\xe2\x80\x99m a man of experience, immense experience, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d and he\r\ntapped his forehead with his fingers in self-approval. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve been a\r\nstudent or have attended some learned institution!... But allow me....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n He got up, staggered, took up his jug and glass, and sat down beside\r\nthe young man, facing him a little sideways. He was drunk, but spoke\r\nfluently and boldly, only occasionally losing the thread of his\r\nsentences and drawling his words. He pounced upon Raskolnikov as\r\ngreedily as though he too had not spoken to a soul for a month.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHonoured sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he began almost with solemnity, \xe2\x80\x9cpoverty is not a vice,\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s a true saying. Yet I know too that drunkenness is not a virtue,\r\nand that that\xe2\x80\x99s even truer. But beggary, honoured sir, beggary is a\r\nvice. In poverty you may still retain your innate nobility of soul, but\r\nin beggary--never--no one. For beggary a man is not chased out of human\r\nsociety with a stick, he is swept out with a broom, so as to make it as\r\nhumiliating as possible; and quite right, too, forasmuch as in beggary\r\nI am ready to be the first to humiliate myself. Hence the pot-house!\r\nHonoured sir, a month ago Mr. Lebeziatnikov gave my wife a beating, and\r\nmy wife is a very different matter from me! Do you understand? Allow me\r\nto ask you another question out of simple curiosity: have you ever spent\r\na night on a hay barge, on the Neva?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I have not happened to,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Raskolnikov. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99ve just come from one and it\xe2\x80\x99s the fifth night I\xe2\x80\x99ve slept\r\nso....\xe2\x80\x9d He filled his glass, emptied it and paused. Bits of hay were in\r\nfact clinging to his clothes and sticking to his hair. It seemed quite\r\nprobable that he had not undressed or washed for the last five days.\r\nHis hands, particularly, were filthy. They were fat and red, with black\r\nnails.\r\n\r\nHis conversation seemed to excite a general though languid interest. The\r\nboys at the counter fell to sniggering. The innkeeper came down from the\r\nupper room, apparently on purpose to listen to the \xe2\x80\x9cfunny fellow\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n and sat down at a little distance, yawning lazily, but with dignity.\r\nEvidently Marmeladov was a familiar figure here, and he had most\r\nlikely acquired his weakness for high-flown speeches from the habit of\r\nfrequently entering into conversation with strangers of all sorts in\r\nthe tavern. This habit develops into a necessity in some drunkards, and\r\nespecially in those who are looked after sharply and kept in order\r\nat home. Hence in the company of other drinkers they try to justify\r\nthemselves and even if possible obtain consideration.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFunny fellow!\xe2\x80\x9d pronounced the innkeeper. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd why don\xe2\x80\x99t you work, why\r\naren\xe2\x80\x99t you at your duty, if you are in the service?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy am I not at my duty, honoured sir,\xe2\x80\x9d Marmeladov went on, addressing\r\nhimself exclusively to Raskolnikov, as though it had been he who put\r\nthat question to him. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy am I not at my duty? Does not my heart ache\r\nto think what a useless worm I am? A month ago when Mr. Lebeziatnikov\r\nbeat my wife with his own hands, and I lay drunk, didn\xe2\x80\x99t I suffer?\r\nExcuse me, young man, has it ever happened to you... hm... well, to\r\npetition hopelessly for a loan?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it has. But what do you mean by hopelessly?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHopelessly in the fullest sense, when you know beforehand that you\r\nwill get nothing by it. You know, for instance, beforehand with positive\r\ncertainty that this man, this most reputable and exemplary citizen, will\r\non no consideration give you money; and indeed I ask you why should he?\r\nFor he knows of course that I shan\xe2\x80\x99t pay it back. From compassion? But\r\nMr. Lebeziatnikov who keeps up with modern ideas explained the other day\r\nthat compassion is forbidden nowadays by science itself, and that that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwhat is done now in England, where there is political economy. Why, I\r\nask you, should he give it to me? And yet though I know beforehand that\r\nhe won\xe2\x80\x99t, I set off to him and...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you go?\xe2\x80\x9d put in Raskolnikov.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, when one has no one, nowhere else one can go! For every man must\r\nhave somewhere to go. Since there are times when one absolutely must\r\ngo somewhere! When my own daughter first went out with a yellow ticket,\r\nthen I had to go... (for my daughter has a yellow passport),\xe2\x80\x9d he added\r\nin parenthesis, looking with a certain uneasiness at the young man.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo matter, sir, no matter!\xe2\x80\x9d he went on hurriedly and with apparent\r\ncomposure when both the boys at the counter guffawed and even the\r\ninnkeeper smiled--\xe2\x80\x9cNo matter, I am not confounded by the wagging of\r\ntheir heads; for everyone knows everything about it already, and all\r\nthat is secret is made open. And I accept it all, not with contempt, but\r\nwith humility. So be it! So be it! \xe2\x80\x98Behold the man!\xe2\x80\x99 Excuse me, young\r\nman, can you.... No, to put it more strongly and more distinctly; not\r\n_can_ you but _dare_ you, looking upon me, assert that I am not a pig?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young man did not answer a word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d the orator began again stolidly and with even increased dignity,\r\nafter waiting for the laughter in the room to subside. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, so be\r\nit, I am a pig, but she is a lady! I have the semblance of a beast, but\r\nKaterina Ivanovna, my spouse, is a person of education and an officer\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndaughter. Granted, granted, I am a scoundrel, but she is a woman of a\r\nnoble heart, full of sentiments, refined by education. And yet... oh,\r\nif only she felt for me! Honoured sir, honoured sir, you know every man\r\nought to have at least one place where people feel for him! But Katerina\r\nIvanovna, though she is magnanimous, she is unjust.... And yet, although\r\nI realise that when she pulls my hair she only does it out of pity--for\r\nI repeat without being ashamed, she pulls my hair, young man,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ndeclared with redoubled dignity, hearing the sniggering again--\xe2\x80\x9cbut, my\r\nGod, if she would but once.... But no, no! It\xe2\x80\x99s all in vain and it\xe2\x80\x99s no\r\nuse talking! No use talking! For more than once, my wish did come true\r\nand more than once she has felt for me but... such is my fate and I am a\r\nbeast by nature!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRather!\xe2\x80\x9d assented the innkeeper yawning. Marmeladov struck his fist\r\nresolutely on the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuch is my fate! Do you know, sir, do you know, I have sold her very\r\nstockings for drink? Not her shoes--that would be more or less in the\r\norder of things, but her stockings, her stockings I have sold for drink!\r\nHer mohair shawl I sold for drink, a present to her long ago, her own\r\nproperty, not mine; and we live in a cold room and she caught cold this\r\nwinter and has begun coughing and spitting blood too. We have three\r\nlittle children and Katerina Ivanovna is at work from morning till\r\nnight; she is scrubbing and cleaning and washing the children, for she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbeen used to cleanliness from a child. But her chest is weak and she has\r\na tendency to consumption and I feel it! Do you suppose I don\xe2\x80\x99t feel it?\r\nAnd the more I drink the more I feel it. That\xe2\x80\x99s why I drink too. I try\r\nto find sympathy and feeling in drink.... I drink so that I may suffer\r\ntwice as much!\xe2\x80\x9d And as though in despair he laid his head down on the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYoung man,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, raising his head again, \xe2\x80\x9cin your face I seem to\r\nread some trouble of mind. When you came in I read it, and that was why\r\nI addressed you at once. For in unfolding to you the story of my life, I\r\ndo not wish to make myself a laughing-stock before these idle listeners,\r\nwho indeed know all about it already, but I am looking for a man\r\nof feeling and education. Know then that my wife was educated in a\r\nhigh-class school for the daughters of noblemen, and on leaving she\r\ndanced the shawl dance before the governor and other personages for\r\nwhich she was presented with a gold medal and a certificate of merit.\r\nThe medal... well, the medal of course was sold--long ago, hm... but the\r\ncertificate of merit is in her trunk still and not long ago she showed\r\nit to our landlady. And although she is most continually on bad terms\r\nwith the landlady, yet she wanted to tell someone or other of her past\r\nhonours and of the happy days that are gone. I don\xe2\x80\x99t condemn her for\r\nit, I don\xe2\x80\x99t blame her, for the one thing left her is recollection of\r\nthe past, and all the rest is dust and ashes. Yes, yes, she is a lady\r\nof spirit, proud and determined. She scrubs the floors herself and has\r\nnothing but black bread to eat, but won\xe2\x80\x99t allow herself to be treated\r\nwith disrespect. That\xe2\x80\x99s why she would not overlook Mr. Lebeziatnikov\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrudeness to her, and so when he gave her a beating for it, she took to\r\nher bed more from the hurt to her feelings than from the blows. She was\r\na widow when I married her, with three children, one smaller than the\r\nother. She married her first husband, an infantry officer, for love, and\r\nran away with him from her father\xe2\x80\x99s house. She was exceedingly fond of\r\nher husband; but he gave way to cards, got into trouble and with that he\r\ndied. He used to beat her at the end: and although she paid him back, of\r\nwhich I have authentic documentary evidence, to this day she speaks of\r\nhim with tears and she throws him up to me; and I am glad, I am glad\r\nthat, though only in imagination, she should think of herself as having\r\nonce been happy.... And she was left at his death with three children in\r\na wild and remote district where I happened to be at the time; and she\r\nwas left in such hopeless poverty that, although I have seen many ups\r\nand downs of all sort, I don\xe2\x80\x99t feel equal to describing it even. Her\r\nrelations had all thrown her off. And she was proud, too, excessively\r\nproud.... And then, honoured sir, and then, I, being at the time a\r\nwidower, with a daughter of fourteen left me by my first wife, offered\r\nher my hand, for I could not bear the sight of such suffering. You can\r\njudge the extremity of her calamities, that she, a woman of education\r\nand culture and distinguished family, should have consented to be my\r\nwife. But she did! Weeping and sobbing and wringing her hands, she\r\nmarried me! For she had nowhere to turn! Do you understand, sir, do you\r\nunderstand what it means when you have absolutely nowhere to turn? No,\r\nthat you don\xe2\x80\x99t understand yet.... And for a whole year, I performed\r\nmy duties conscientiously and faithfully, and did not touch this\xe2\x80\x9d (he\r\ntapped the jug with his finger), \xe2\x80\x9cfor I have feelings. But even so, I\r\ncould not please her; and then I lost my place too, and that through no\r\nfault of mine but through changes in the office; and then I did touch\r\nit!... It will be a year and a half ago soon since we found ourselves at\r\nlast after many wanderings and numerous calamities in this magnificent\r\ncapital, adorned with innumerable monuments. Here I obtained a\r\nsituation.... I obtained it and I lost it again. Do you understand? This\r\ntime it was through my own fault I lost it: for my weakness had come\r\nout.... We have now part of a room at Amalia Fyodorovna Lippevechsel\xe2\x80\x99s;\r\nand what we live upon and what we pay our rent with, I could not say.\r\nThere are a lot of people living there besides ourselves. Dirt and\r\ndisorder, a perfect Bedlam... hm... yes... And meanwhile my daughter by\r\nmy first wife has grown up; and what my daughter has had to put up with\r\nfrom her step-mother whilst she was growing up, I won\xe2\x80\x99t speak of. For,\r\nthough Katerina Ivanovna is full of generous feelings, she is a spirited\r\nlady, irritable and short-tempered.... Yes. But it\xe2\x80\x99s no use going over\r\nthat! Sonia, as you may well fancy, has had no education. I did make an\r\neffort four years ago to give her a course of geography and universal\r\nhistory, but as I was not very well up in those subjects myself and we\r\nhad no suitable books, and what books we had... hm, anyway we have not\r\neven those now, so all our instruction came to an end. We stopped at\r\nCyrus of Persia. Since she has attained years of maturity, she has read\r\nother books of romantic tendency and of late she had read with great\r\ninterest a book she got through Mr. Lebeziatnikov, Lewes\xe2\x80\x99 Physiology--do\r\nyou know it?--and even recounted extracts from it to us: and that\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nwhole of her education. And now may I venture to address you, honoured\r\nsir, on my own account with a private question. Do you suppose that\r\na respectable poor girl can earn much by honest work? Not fifteen\r\nfarthings a day can she earn, if she is respectable and has no special\r\ntalent and that without putting her work down for an instant! And what\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmore, Ivan Ivanitch Klopstock the civil counsellor--have you heard of\r\nhim?--has not to this day paid her for the half-dozen linen shirts she\r\nmade him and drove her roughly away, stamping and reviling her, on the\r\npretext that the shirt collars were not made like the pattern and were\r\nput in askew. And there are the little ones hungry.... And Katerina\r\nIvanovna walking up and down and wringing her hands, her cheeks flushed\r\nred, as they always are in that disease: \xe2\x80\x98Here you live with us,\xe2\x80\x99 says\r\nshe, \xe2\x80\x98you eat and drink and are kept warm and you do nothing to help.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nAnd much she gets to eat and drink when there is not a crust for the\r\nlittle ones for three days! I was lying at the time... well, what of\r\nit! I was lying drunk and I heard my Sonia speaking (she is a gentle\r\ncreature with a soft little voice... fair hair and such a pale, thin\r\nlittle face). She said: \xe2\x80\x98Katerina Ivanovna, am I really to do a thing\r\nlike that?\xe2\x80\x99 And Darya Frantsovna, a woman of evil character and very\r\nwell known to the police, had two or three times tried to get at her\r\nthrough the landlady. \xe2\x80\x98And why not?\xe2\x80\x99 said Katerina Ivanovna with a jeer,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98you are something mighty precious to be so careful of!\xe2\x80\x99 But don\xe2\x80\x99t blame\r\nher, don\xe2\x80\x99t blame her, honoured sir, don\xe2\x80\x99t blame her! She was not herself\r\nwhen she spoke, but driven to distraction by her illness and the crying\r\nof the hungry children; and it was said more to wound her than anything\r\nelse.... For that\xe2\x80\x99s Katerina Ivanovna\xe2\x80\x99s character, and when children\r\ncry, even from hunger, she falls to beating them at once. At six o\xe2\x80\x99clock\r\nI saw Sonia get up, put on her kerchief and her cape, and go out of the\r\nroom and about nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock she came back. She walked straight up to\r\nKaterina Ivanovna and she laid thirty roubles on the table before her\r\nin silence. She did not utter a word, she did not even look at her, she\r\nsimply picked up our big green _drap de dames_ shawl (we have a shawl,\r\nmade of _drap de dames_), put it over her head and face and lay down\r\non the bed with her face to the wall; only her little shoulders and her\r\nbody kept shuddering.... And I went on lying there, just as before....\r\nAnd then I saw, young man, I saw Katerina Ivanovna, in the same silence\r\ngo up to Sonia\xe2\x80\x99s little bed; she was on her knees all the evening\r\nkissing Sonia\xe2\x80\x99s feet, and would not get up, and then they both fell\r\nasleep in each other\xe2\x80\x99s arms... together, together... yes... and I... lay\r\ndrunk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarmeladov stopped short, as though his voice had failed him. Then he\r\nhurriedly filled his glass, drank, and cleared his throat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSince then, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on after a brief pause--\xe2\x80\x9cSince then, owing\r\nto an unfortunate occurrence and through information given by\r\nevil-intentioned persons--in all which Darya Frantsovna took a\r\nleading part on the pretext that she had been treated with want of\r\nrespect--since then my daughter Sofya Semyonovna has been forced to take\r\na yellow ticket, and owing to that she is unable to go on living with\r\nus. For our landlady, Amalia Fyodorovna would not hear of it (though\r\nshe had backed up Darya Frantsovna before) and Mr. Lebeziatnikov too...\r\nhm.... All the trouble between him and Katerina Ivanovna was on Sonia\xe2\x80\x99s\r\naccount. At first he was for making up to Sonia himself and then all of\r\na sudden he stood on his dignity: \xe2\x80\x98how,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98can a highly educated\r\nman like me live in the same rooms with a girl like that?\xe2\x80\x99 And Katerina\r\nIvanovna would not let it pass, she stood up for her... and so that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhow it happened. And Sonia comes to us now, mostly after dark; she\r\ncomforts Katerina Ivanovna and gives her all she can.... She has a room\r\nat the Kapernaumovs\xe2\x80\x99 the tailors, she lodges with them; Kapernaumov is\r\na lame man with a cleft palate and all of his numerous family have cleft\r\npalates too. And his wife, too, has a cleft palate. They all live in one\r\nroom, but Sonia has her own, partitioned off.... Hm... yes... very poor\r\npeople and all with cleft palates... yes. Then I got up in the morning,\r\nand put on my rags, lifted up my hands to heaven and set off to his\r\nexcellency Ivan Afanasyvitch. His excellency Ivan Afanasyvitch, do you\r\nknow him? No? Well, then, it\xe2\x80\x99s a man of God you don\xe2\x80\x99t know. He is wax...\r\nwax before the face of the Lord; even as wax melteth!... His eyes were\r\ndim when he heard my story. \xe2\x80\x98Marmeladov, once already you have\r\ndeceived my expectations... I\xe2\x80\x99ll take you once more on my own\r\nresponsibility\xe2\x80\x99--that\xe2\x80\x99s what he said, \xe2\x80\x98remember,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98and now you\r\ncan go.\xe2\x80\x99 I kissed the dust at his feet--in thought only, for in reality\r\nhe would not have allowed me to do it, being a statesman and a man of\r\nmodern political and enlightened ideas. I returned home, and when I\r\nannounced that I\xe2\x80\x99d been taken back into the service and should receive a\r\nsalary, heavens, what a to-do there was!...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarmeladov stopped again in violent excitement. At that moment a whole\r\nparty of revellers already drunk came in from the street, and the sounds\r\nof a hired concertina and the cracked piping voice of a child of seven\r\nsinging \xe2\x80\x9cThe Hamlet\xe2\x80\x9d were heard in the entry. The room was filled with\r\nnoise. The tavern-keeper and the boys were busy with the new-comers.\r\nMarmeladov paying no attention to the new arrivals continued his story.\r\nHe appeared by now to be extremely weak, but as he became more and more\r\ndrunk, he became more and more talkative. The recollection of his\r\nrecent success in getting the situation seemed to revive him, and was\r\npositively reflected in a sort of radiance on his face. Raskolnikov\r\nlistened attentively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was five weeks ago, sir. Yes.... As soon as Katerina Ivanovna\r\nand Sonia heard of it, mercy on us, it was as though I stepped into the\r\nkingdom of Heaven. It used to be: you can lie like a beast, nothing but\r\nabuse. Now they were walking on tiptoe, hushing the children. \xe2\x80\x98Semyon\r\nZaharovitch is tired with his work at the office, he is resting, shh!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nThey made me coffee before I went to work and boiled cream for me! They\r\nbegan to get real cream for me, do you hear that? And how they managed\r\nto get together the money for a decent outfit--eleven roubles, fifty\r\ncopecks, I can\xe2\x80\x99t guess. Boots, cotton shirt-fronts--most magnificent,\r\na uniform, they got up all in splendid style, for eleven roubles and\r\na half. The first morning I came back from the office I found Katerina\r\nIvanovna had cooked two courses for dinner--soup and salt meat with\r\nhorse radish--which we had never dreamed of till then. She had not any\r\ndresses... none at all, but she got herself up as though she were going\r\non a visit; and not that she\xe2\x80\x99d anything to do it with, she smartened\r\nherself up with nothing at all, she\xe2\x80\x99d done her hair nicely, put on a\r\nclean collar of some sort, cuffs, and there she was, quite a different\r\nperson, she was younger and better looking. Sonia, my little darling,\r\nhad only helped with money \xe2\x80\x98for the time,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98it won\xe2\x80\x99t do for me\r\nto come and see you too often. After dark maybe when no one can see.\xe2\x80\x99 Do\r\nyou hear, do you hear? I lay down for a nap after dinner and what do you\r\nthink: though Katerina Ivanovna had quarrelled to the last degree with\r\nour landlady Amalia Fyodorovna only a week before, she could not\r\nresist then asking her in to coffee. For two hours they were sitting,\r\nwhispering together. \xe2\x80\x98Semyon Zaharovitch is in the service again,\r\nnow, and receiving a salary,\xe2\x80\x99 says she, \xe2\x80\x98and he went himself to his\r\nexcellency and his excellency himself came out to him, made all the\r\nothers wait and led Semyon Zaharovitch by the hand before everybody into\r\nhis study.\xe2\x80\x99 Do you hear, do you hear? \xe2\x80\x98To be sure,\xe2\x80\x99 says he, \xe2\x80\x98Semyon\r\nZaharovitch, remembering your past services,\xe2\x80\x99 says he, \xe2\x80\x98and in spite\r\nof your propensity to that foolish weakness, since you promise now and\r\nsince moreover we\xe2\x80\x99ve got on badly without you,\xe2\x80\x99 (do you hear, do you\r\nhear;) \xe2\x80\x98and so,\xe2\x80\x99 says he, \xe2\x80\x98I rely now on your word as a gentleman.\xe2\x80\x99 And\r\nall that, let me tell you, she has simply made up for herself, and not\r\nsimply out of wantonness, for the sake of bragging; no, she believes it\r\nall herself, she amuses herself with her own fancies, upon my word she\r\ndoes! And I don\xe2\x80\x99t blame her for it, no, I don\xe2\x80\x99t blame her!... Six days\r\nago when I brought her my first earnings in full--twenty-three roubles\r\nforty copecks altogether--she called me her poppet: \xe2\x80\x98poppet,\xe2\x80\x99 said she,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98my little poppet.\xe2\x80\x99 And when we were by ourselves, you understand?\r\nYou would not think me a beauty, you would not think much of me as a\r\nhusband, would you?... Well, she pinched my cheek, \xe2\x80\x98my little poppet,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid she.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarmeladov broke off, tried to smile, but suddenly his chin began\r\nto twitch. He controlled himself however. The tavern, the degraded\r\nappearance of the man, the five nights in the hay barge, and the pot of\r\nspirits, and yet this poignant love for his wife and children bewildered\r\nhis listener. Raskolnikov listened intently but with a sick sensation.\r\nHe felt vexed that he had come here.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHonoured sir, honoured sir,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Marmeladov recovering himself--\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\r\nsir, perhaps all this seems a laughing matter to you, as it does to\r\nothers, and perhaps I am only worrying you with the stupidity of all the\r\ntrivial details of my home life, but it is not a laughing matter to me.\r\nFor I can feel it all.... And the whole of that heavenly day of my life\r\nand the whole of that evening I passed in fleeting dreams of how I would\r\narrange it all, and how I would dress all the children, and how I should\r\ngive her rest, and how I should rescue my own daughter from dishonour\r\nand restore her to the bosom of her family.... And a great deal more....\r\nQuite excusable, sir. Well, then, sir\xe2\x80\x9d (Marmeladov suddenly gave a sort\r\nof start, raised his head and gazed intently at his listener) \xe2\x80\x9cwell, on\r\nthe very next day after all those dreams, that is to say, exactly five\r\ndays ago, in the evening, by a cunning trick, like a thief in the night,\r\nI stole from Katerina Ivanovna the key of her box, took out what was\r\nleft of my earnings, how much it was I have forgotten, and now look\r\nat me, all of you! It\xe2\x80\x99s the fifth day since I left home, and they are\r\nlooking for me there and it\xe2\x80\x99s the end of my employment, and my uniform\r\nis lying in a tavern on the Egyptian bridge. I exchanged it for the\r\ngarments I have on... and it\xe2\x80\x99s the end of everything!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarmeladov struck his forehead with his fist, clenched his teeth, closed\r\nhis eyes and leaned heavily with his elbow on the table. But a minute\r\nlater his face suddenly changed and with a certain assumed slyness and\r\naffectation of bravado, he glanced at Raskolnikov, laughed and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis morning I went to see Sonia, I went to ask her for a pick-me-up!\r\nHe-he-he!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t say she gave it to you?\xe2\x80\x9d cried one of the new-comers; he\r\nshouted the words and went off into a guffaw.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis very quart was bought with her money,\xe2\x80\x9d Marmeladov declared,\r\naddressing himself exclusively to Raskolnikov. \xe2\x80\x9cThirty copecks she gave\r\nme with her own hands, her last, all she had, as I saw.... She said\r\nnothing, she only looked at me without a word.... Not on earth, but up\r\nyonder... they grieve over men, they weep, but they don\xe2\x80\x99t blame them,\r\nthey don\xe2\x80\x99t blame them! But it hurts more, it hurts more when they don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nblame! Thirty copecks yes! And maybe she needs them now, eh? What do\r\nyou think, my dear sir? For now she\xe2\x80\x99s got to keep up her appearance. It\r\ncosts money, that smartness, that special smartness, you know? Do you\r\nunderstand? And there\xe2\x80\x99s pomatum, too, you see, she must have things;\r\npetticoats, starched ones, shoes, too, real jaunty ones to show off her\r\nfoot when she has to step over a puddle. Do you understand, sir, do you\r\nunderstand what all that smartness means? And here I, her own father,\r\nhere I took thirty copecks of that money for a drink! And I am drinking\r\nit! And I have already drunk it! Come, who will have pity on a man like\r\nme, eh? Are you sorry for me, sir, or not? Tell me, sir, are you sorry\r\nor not? He-he-he!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe would have filled his glass, but there was no drink left. The pot was\r\nempty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you to be pitied for?\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the tavern-keeper who was again\r\nnear them.\r\n\r\nShouts of laughter and even oaths followed. The laughter and the oaths\r\ncame from those who were listening and also from those who had heard\r\nnothing but were simply looking at the figure of the discharged\r\ngovernment clerk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be pitied! Why am I to be pitied?\xe2\x80\x9d Marmeladov suddenly declaimed,\r\nstanding up with his arm outstretched, as though he had been only\r\nwaiting for that question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy am I to be pitied, you say? Yes! there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to pity me for! I\r\nought to be crucified, crucified on a cross, not pitied! Crucify me,\r\noh judge, crucify me but pity me! And then I will go of myself to be\r\ncrucified, for it\xe2\x80\x99s not merry-making I seek but tears and tribulation!...\r\nDo you suppose, you that sell, that this pint of yours has been\r\nsweet to me? It was tribulation I sought at the bottom of it, tears and\r\ntribulation, and have found it, and I have tasted it; but He will pity\r\nus Who has had pity on all men, Who has understood all men and all\r\nthings, He is the One, He too is the judge. He will come in that day\r\nand He will ask: \xe2\x80\x98Where is the daughter who gave herself for her cross,\r\nconsumptive step-mother and for the little children of another? Where is\r\nthe daughter who had pity upon the filthy drunkard, her earthly father,\r\nundismayed by his beastliness?\xe2\x80\x99 And He will say, \xe2\x80\x98Come to me! I have\r\nalready forgiven thee once.... I have forgiven thee once.... Thy sins\r\nwhich are many are forgiven thee for thou hast loved much....\xe2\x80\x99 And he\r\nwill forgive my Sonia, He will forgive, I know it... I felt it in my\r\nheart when I was with her just now! And He will judge and will forgive\r\nall, the good and the evil, the wise and the meek.... And when He has\r\ndone with all of them, then He will summon us. \xe2\x80\x98You too come forth,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nHe will say, \xe2\x80\x98Come forth ye drunkards, come forth, ye weak ones, come\r\nforth, ye children of shame!\xe2\x80\x99 And we shall all come forth, without shame\r\nand shall stand before him. And He will say unto us, \xe2\x80\x98Ye are swine, made\r\nin the Image of the Beast and with his mark; but come ye also!\xe2\x80\x99 And the\r\nwise ones and those of understanding will say, \xe2\x80\x98Oh Lord, why dost Thou\r\nreceive these men?\xe2\x80\x99 And He will say, \xe2\x80\x98This is why I receive them, oh ye\r\nwise, this is why I receive them, oh ye of understanding, that not one\r\nof them believed himself to be worthy of this.\xe2\x80\x99 And He will hold out His\r\nhands to us and we shall fall down before him... and we shall weep...\r\nand we shall understand all things! Then we shall understand all!... and\r\nall will understand, Katerina Ivanovna even... she will understand....\r\nLord, Thy kingdom come!\xe2\x80\x9d And he sank down on the bench exhausted, and\r\nhelpless, looking at no one, apparently oblivious of his surroundings\r\nand plunged in deep thought. His words had created a certain impression;\r\nthere was a moment of silence; but soon laughter and oaths were heard\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s his notion!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTalked himself silly!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA fine clerk he is!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd so on, and so on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us go, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marmeladov all at once, raising his head and\r\naddressing Raskolnikov--\xe2\x80\x9ccome along with me... Kozel\xe2\x80\x99s house, looking\r\ninto the yard. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to Katerina Ivanovna--time I did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRaskolnikov had for some time been wanting to go and he had meant to\r\nhelp him. Marmeladov was much unsteadier on his legs than in his speech\r\nand leaned heavily on the young man. They had two or three hundred\r\npaces to go. The drunken man was more and more overcome by dismay and\r\nconfusion as they drew nearer the house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not Katerina Ivanovna I am afraid of now,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered in\r\nagitation--\xe2\x80\x9cand that she will begin pulling my hair. What does my hair\r\nmatter! Bother my hair! That\xe2\x80\x99s what I say! Indeed it will be better if\r\nshe does begin pulling it, that\xe2\x80\x99s not what I am afraid of... it\xe2\x80\x99s her\r\neyes I am afraid of... yes, her eyes... the red on her cheeks, too,\r\nfrightens me... and her breathing too.... Have you noticed how people\r\nin that disease breathe... when they are excited? I am frightened of\r\nthe children\xe2\x80\x99s crying, too.... For if Sonia has not taken them food...\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what\xe2\x80\x99s happened! I don\xe2\x80\x99t know! But blows I am not afraid\r\nof.... Know, sir, that such blows are not a pain to me, but even an\r\nenjoyment. In fact I can\xe2\x80\x99t get on without it.... It\xe2\x80\x99s better so. Let\r\nher strike me, it relieves her heart... it\xe2\x80\x99s better so... There is the\r\nhouse. The house of Kozel, the cabinet-maker... a German, well-to-do.\r\nLead the way!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey went in from the yard and up to the fourth storey. The staircase\r\ngot darker and darker as they went up. It was nearly eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock\r\nand although in summer in Petersburg there is no real night, yet it was\r\nquite dark at the top of the stairs.\r\n\r\nA grimy little door at the very top of the stairs stood ajar. A very\r\npoor-looking room about ten paces long was lighted up by a candle-end;\r\nthe whole of it was visible from the entrance. It was all in disorder,\r\nlittered up with rags of all sorts, especially children\xe2\x80\x99s garments.\r\nAcross the furthest corner was stretched a ragged sheet. Behind it\r\nprobably was the bed. There was nothing in the room except two chairs\r\nand a sofa covered with American leather, full of holes, before which\r\nstood an old deal kitchen-table, unpainted and uncovered. At the edge\r\nof the table stood a smoldering tallow-candle in an iron candlestick. It\r\nappeared that the family had a room to themselves, not part of a room,\r\nbut their room was practically a passage. The door leading to the other\r\nrooms, or rather cupboards, into which Amalia Lippevechsel\xe2\x80\x99s flat was\r\ndivided stood half open, and there was shouting, uproar and laughter\r\nwithin. People seemed to be playing cards and drinking tea there. Words\r\nof the most unceremonious kind flew out from time to time.\r\n\r\nRaskolnikov recognised Katerina Ivanovna at once. She was a rather tall,\r\nslim and graceful woman, terribly emaciated, with magnificent dark brown\r\nhair and with a hectic flush in her cheeks. She was pacing up and down\r\nin her little room, pressing her hands against her chest; her lips\r\nwere parched and her breathing came in nervous broken gasps. Her eyes\r\nglittered as in fever and looked about with a harsh immovable stare. And\r\nthat consumptive and excited face with the last flickering light of the\r\ncandle-end playing upon it made a sickening impression. She seemed to\r\nRaskolnikov about thirty years old and was certainly a strange wife for\r\nMarmeladov.... She had not heard them and did not notice them coming in.\r\nShe seemed to be lost in thought, hearing and seeing nothing. The room\r\nwas close, but she had not opened the window; a stench rose from the\r\nstaircase, but the door on to the stairs was not closed. From the inner\r\nrooms clouds of tobacco smoke floated in, she kept coughing, but did not\r\nclose the door. The youngest child, a girl of six, was asleep, sitting\r\ncurled up on the floor with her head on the sofa. A boy a year older\r\nstood crying and shaking in the corner, probably he had just had a\r\nbeating. Beside him stood a girl of nine years old, tall and thin,\r\nwearing a thin and ragged chemise with an ancient cashmere pelisse flung\r\nover her bare shoulders, long outgrown and barely reaching her knees.\r\nHer arm, as thin as a stick, was round her brother\xe2\x80\x99s neck. She was\r\ntrying to comfort him, whispering something to him, and doing all she\r\ncould to keep him from whimpering again. At the same time her large\r\ndark eyes, which looked larger still from the thinness of her frightened\r\nface, were watching her mother with alarm. Marmeladov did not enter the\r\ndoor, but dropped on his knees in the very doorway, pushing Raskolnikov\r\nin front of him. The woman seeing a stranger stopped indifferently\r\nfacing him, coming to herself for a moment and apparently wondering what\r\nhe had come for. But evidently she decided that he was going into\r\nthe next room, as he had to pass through hers to get there. Taking no\r\nfurther notice of him, she walked towards the outer door to close it\r\nand uttered a sudden scream on seeing her husband on his knees in the\r\ndoorway.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried out in a frenzy, \xe2\x80\x9che has come back! The criminal! the\r\nmonster!... And where is the money? What\xe2\x80\x99s in your pocket, show me! And\r\nyour clothes are all different! Where are your clothes? Where is the\r\nmoney! Speak!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd she fell to searching him. Marmeladov submissively and obediently\r\nheld up both arms to facilitate the search. Not a farthing was there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is the money?\xe2\x80\x9d she cried--\xe2\x80\x9cMercy on us, can he have drunk it all?\r\nThere were twelve silver roubles left in the chest!\xe2\x80\x9d and in a fury\r\nshe seized him by the hair and dragged him into the room. Marmeladov\r\nseconded her efforts by meekly crawling along on his knees.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd this is a consolation to me! This does not hurt me, but is a\r\npositive con-so-la-tion, ho-nou-red sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he called out, shaken to and\r\nfro by his hair and even once striking the ground with his forehead.\r\nThe child asleep on the floor woke up, and began to cry. The boy in the\r\ncorner losing all control began trembling and screaming and rushed\r\nto his sister in violent terror, almost in a fit. The eldest girl was\r\nshaking like a leaf.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s drunk it! he\xe2\x80\x99s drunk it all,\xe2\x80\x9d the poor woman screamed in\r\ndespair--\xe2\x80\x9cand his clothes are gone! And they are hungry, hungry!\xe2\x80\x9d--and\r\nwringing her hands she pointed to the children. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, accursed life!\r\nAnd you, are you not ashamed?\xe2\x80\x9d--she pounced all at once upon\r\nRaskolnikov--\xe2\x80\x9cfrom the tavern! Have you been drinking with him? You have\r\nbeen drinking with him, too! Go away!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young man was hastening away without uttering a word. The inner door\r\nwas thrown wide open and inquisitive faces were peering in at it. Coarse\r\nlaughing faces with pipes and cigarettes and heads wearing caps thrust\r\nthemselves in at the doorway. Further in could be seen figures in\r\ndressing gowns flung open, in costumes of unseemly scantiness, some of\r\nthem with cards in their hands. They were particularly diverted, when\r\nMarmeladov, dragged about by his hair, shouted that it was a consolation\r\nto him. They even began to come into the room; at last a sinister shrill\r\noutcry was heard: this came from Amalia Lippevechsel herself pushing her\r\nway amongst them and trying to restore order after her own fashion and\r\nfor the hundredth time to frighten the poor woman by ordering her\r\nwith coarse abuse to clear out of the room next day. As he went out,\r\nRaskolnikov had time to put his hand into his pocket, to snatch up the\r\ncoppers he had received in exchange for his rouble in the tavern and to\r\nlay them unnoticed on the window. Afterwards on the stairs, he changed\r\nhis mind and would have gone back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a stupid thing I\xe2\x80\x99ve done,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cthey have Sonia\r\nand I want it myself.\xe2\x80\x9d But reflecting that it would be impossible to\r\ntake it back now and that in any case he would not have taken it, he\r\ndismissed it with a wave of his hand and went back to his lodging.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSonia wants pomatum too,\xe2\x80\x9d he said as he walked along the street, and he\r\nlaughed malignantly--\xe2\x80\x9csuch smartness costs money.... Hm! And maybe Sonia\r\nherself will be bankrupt to-day, for there is always a risk, hunting\r\nbig game... digging for gold... then they would all be without a crust\r\nto-morrow except for my money. Hurrah for Sonia! What a mine they\xe2\x80\x99ve dug\r\nthere! And they\xe2\x80\x99re making the most of it! Yes, they are making the most\r\nof it! They\xe2\x80\x99ve wept over it and grown used to it. Man grows used to\r\neverything, the scoundrel!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe sank into thought.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what if I am wrong,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried suddenly after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s thought.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat if man is not really a scoundrel, man in general, I mean, the\r\nwhole race of mankind--then all the rest is prejudice, simply artificial\r\nterrors and there are no barriers and it\xe2\x80\x99s all as it should be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nHe waked up late next day after a broken sleep. But his sleep had not\r\nrefreshed him; he waked up bilious, irritable, ill-tempered, and looked\r\nwith hatred at his room. It was a tiny cupboard of a room about six\r\npaces in length. It had a poverty-stricken appearance with its dusty\r\nyellow paper peeling off the walls, and it was so low-pitched that a man\r\nof more than average height was ill at ease in it and felt every moment\r\nthat he would knock his head against the ceiling. The furniture was in\r\nkeeping with the room: there were three old chairs, rather rickety; a\r\npainted table in the corner on which lay a few manuscripts and books;\r\nthe dust that lay thick upon them showed that they had been long\r\nuntouched. A big clumsy sofa occupied almost the whole of one wall and\r\nhalf the floor space of the room; it was once covered with chintz, but\r\nwas now in rags and served Raskolnikov as a bed. Often he went to sleep\r\non it, as he was, without undressing, without sheets, wrapped in his old\r\nstudent\xe2\x80\x99s overcoat, with his head on one little pillow, under which he\r\nheaped up all the linen he had, clean and dirty, by way of a bolster. A\r\nlittle table stood in front of the sofa.\r\n\r\nIt would have been difficult to sink to a lower ebb of disorder, but to\r\nRaskolnikov in his present state of mind this was positively agreeable.\r\nHe had got completely away from everyone, like a tortoise in its shell,\r\nand even the sight of a servant girl who had to wait upon him and looked\r\nsometimes into his room made him writhe with nervous irritation. He was\r\nin the condition that overtakes some monomaniacs entirely concentrated\r\nupon one thing. His landlady had for the last fortnight given up sending\r\nhim in meals, and he had not yet thought of expostulating with her,\r\nthough he went without his dinner. Nastasya, the cook and only servant,\r\nwas rather pleased at the lodger\xe2\x80\x99s mood and had entirely given up\r\nsweeping and doing his room, only once a week or so she would stray into\r\nhis room with a broom. She waked him up that day.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet up, why are you asleep?\xe2\x80\x9d she called to him. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s past nine, I have\r\nbrought you some tea; will you have a cup? I should think you\xe2\x80\x99re fairly\r\nstarving?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRaskolnikov opened his eyes, started and recognised Nastasya.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom the landlady, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, slowly and with a sickly face sitting\r\nup on the sofa.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom the landlady, indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe set before him her own cracked teapot full of weak and stale tea and\r\nlaid two yellow lumps of sugar by the side of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere, Nastasya, take it please,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, fumbling in his pocket (for\r\nhe had slept in his clothes) and taking out a handful of coppers--\xe2\x80\x9crun\r\nand buy me a loaf. And get me a little sausage, the cheapest, at the\r\npork-butcher\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe loaf I\xe2\x80\x99ll fetch you this very minute, but wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you rather have\r\nsome cabbage soup instead of sausage? It\xe2\x80\x99s capital soup, yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s. I\r\nsaved it for you yesterday, but you came in late. It\xe2\x80\x99s fine soup.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen the soup had been brought, and he had begun upon it, Nastasya\r\nsat down beside him on the sofa and began chatting. She was a country\r\npeasant-woman and a very talkative one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPraskovya Pavlovna means to complain to the police about you,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nHe scowled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo the police? What does she want?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t pay her money and you won\xe2\x80\x99t turn out of the room. That\xe2\x80\x99s what\r\nshe wants, to be sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe devil, that\xe2\x80\x99s the last straw,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered, grinding his teeth,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cno, that would not suit me... just now. She is a fool,\xe2\x80\x9d he added aloud.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go and talk to her to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFool she is and no mistake, just as I am. But why, if you are so\r\nclever, do you lie here like a sack and have nothing to show for it? One\r\ntime you used to go out, you say, to teach children. But why is it you\r\ndo nothing now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am doing...\xe2\x80\x9d Raskolnikov began sullenly and reluctantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWork...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat sort of work?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am thinking,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered seriously after a pause.\r\n\r\nNastasya was overcome with a fit of laughter. She was given to laughter\r\nand when anything amused her, she laughed inaudibly, quivering and\r\nshaking all over till she felt ill.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd have you made much money by your thinking?\xe2\x80\x9d she managed to\r\narticulate at last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne can\xe2\x80\x99t go out to give lessons without boots. And I\xe2\x80\x99m sick of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t quarrel with your bread and butter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey pay so little for lessons. What\xe2\x80\x99s the use of a few coppers?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nanswered, reluctantly, as though replying to his own thought.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you want to get a fortune all at once?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked at her strangely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I want a fortune,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered firmly, after a brief pause.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be in such a hurry, you quite frighten me! Shall I get you the\r\nloaf or not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs you please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, I forgot! A letter came for you yesterday when you were out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA letter? for me! from whom?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t say. I gave three copecks of my own to the postman for it. Will\r\nyou pay me back?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen bring it to me, for God\xe2\x80\x99s sake, bring it,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Raskolnikov\r\ngreatly excited--\xe2\x80\x9cgood God!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA minute later the letter was brought him. That was it: from his mother,\r\nfrom the province of R----. He turned pale when he took it. It was a\r\nlong while since he had received a letter, but another feeling also\r\nsuddenly stabbed his heart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNastasya, leave me alone, for goodness\xe2\x80\x99 sake; here are your three\r\ncopecks, but for goodness\xe2\x80\x99 sake, make haste and go!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe letter was quivering in his hand; he did not want to open it in her\r\npresence; he wanted to be left _alone_ with this letter. When Nastasya\r\nhad gone out, he lifted it quickly to his lips and kissed it; then he\r\ngazed intently at the address, the small, sloping handwriting, so dear\r\nand familiar, of the mother who had once taught him to read and write.\r\nHe delayed; he seemed almost afraid of something. At last he opened it;\r\nit was a thick heavy letter, weighing over two ounces, two large sheets\r\nof note paper were covered with very small handwriting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Rodya,\xe2\x80\x9d wrote his mother--\xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s two months since I last had a\r\ntalk with you by letter which has distressed me and even kept me\r\nawake at night, thinking. But I am sure you will not blame me for my\r\ninevitable silence. You know how I love you; you are all we have to look\r\nto, Dounia and I, you are our all, our one hope, our one stay. What a\r\ngrief it was to me when I heard that you had given up the university\r\nsome months ago, for want of means to keep yourself and that you had\r\nlost your lessons and your other work! How could I help you out of my\r\nhundred and twenty roubles a year pension? The fifteen roubles I sent\r\nyou four months ago I borrowed, as you know, on security of my pension,\r\nfrom Vassily Ivanovitch Vahrushin a merchant of this town. He is a\r\nkind-hearted man and was a friend of your father\xe2\x80\x99s too. But having given\r\nhim the right to receive the pension, I had to wait till the debt was\r\npaid off and that is only just done, so that I\xe2\x80\x99ve been unable to send\r\nyou anything all this time. But now, thank God, I believe I shall\r\nbe able to send you something more and in fact we may congratulate\r\nourselves on our good fortune now, of which I hasten to inform you. In\r\nthe first place, would you have guessed, dear Rodya, that your sister\r\nhas been living with me for the last six weeks and we shall not be\r\nseparated in the future. Thank God, her sufferings are over, but I will\r\ntell you everything in order, so that you may know just how everything\r\nhas happened and all that we have hitherto concealed from you. When you\r\nwrote to me two months ago that you had heard that Dounia had a great\r\ndeal to put up with in the Svidriga\xc3\xaflovs\xe2\x80\x99 house, when you wrote that\r\nand asked me to tell you all about it--what could I write in answer to\r\nyou? If I had written the whole truth to you, I dare say you would have\r\nthrown up everything and have come to us, even if you had to walk all\r\nthe way, for I know your character and your feelings, and you would not\r\nlet your sister be insulted. I was in despair myself, but what could I\r\ndo? And, besides, I did not know the whole truth myself then. What\r\nmade it all so difficult was that Dounia received a hundred roubles\r\nin advance when she took the place as governess in their family, on\r\ncondition of part of her salary being deducted every month, and so it\r\nwas impossible to throw up the situation without repaying the debt.\r\nThis sum (now I can explain it all to you, my precious Rodya) she took\r\nchiefly in order to send you sixty roubles, which you needed so terribly\r\nthen and which you received from us last year. We deceived you then,\r\nwriting that this money came from Dounia\xe2\x80\x99s savings, but that was not\r\nso, and now I tell you all about it, because, thank God, things have\r\nsuddenly changed for the better, and that you may know how Dounia loves\r\nyou and what a heart she has. At first indeed Mr. Svidriga\xc3\xaflov treated\r\nher very rudely and used to make disrespectful and jeering remarks at\r\ntable.... But I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to go into all those painful details, so as\r\nnot to worry you for nothing when it is now all over. In short, in spite\r\nof the kind and generous behaviour of Marfa Petrovna, Mr. Svidriga\xc3\xaflov\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwife, and all the rest of the household, Dounia had a very hard time,\r\nespecially when Mr. Svidriga\xc3\xaflov, relapsing into his old regimental\r\nhabits, was under the influence of Bacchus. And how do you think it\r\nwas all explained later on? Would you believe that the crazy fellow had\r\nconceived a passion for Dounia from the beginning, but had concealed\r\nit under a show of rudeness and contempt. Possibly he was ashamed and\r\nhorrified himself at his own flighty hopes, considering his years and\r\nhis being the father of a family; and that made him angry with Dounia.\r\nAnd possibly, too, he hoped by his rude and sneering behaviour to hide\r\nthe truth from others. But at last he lost all control and had the face\r\nto make Dounia an open and shameful proposal, promising her all sorts of\r\ninducements and offering, besides, to throw up everything and take her\r\nto another estate of his, or even abroad. You can imagine all she went\r\nthrough! To leave her situation at once was impossible not only on\r\naccount of the money debt, but also to spare the feelings of Marfa\r\nPetrovna, whose suspicions would have been aroused: and then Dounia\r\nwould have been the cause of a rupture in the family. And it would\r\nhave meant a terrible scandal for Dounia too; that would have been\r\ninevitable. There were various other reasons owing to which Dounia could\r\nnot hope to escape from that awful house for another six weeks. You know\r\nDounia, of course; you know how clever she is and what a strong will she\r\nhas. Dounia can endure a great deal and even in the most difficult cases\r\nshe has the fortitude to maintain her firmness. She did not even write\r\nto me about everything for fear of upsetting me, although we were\r\nconstantly in communication. It all ended very unexpectedly. Marfa\r\nPetrovna accidentally overheard her husband imploring Dounia in the\r\ngarden, and, putting quite a wrong interpretation on the position, threw\r\nthe blame upon her, believing her to be the cause of it all. An awful\r\nscene took place between them on the spot in the garden; Marfa Petrovna\r\nwent so far as to strike Dounia, refused to hear anything and was\r\nshouting at her for a whole hour and then gave orders that Dounia should\r\nbe packed off at once to me in a plain peasant\xe2\x80\x99s cart, into which they\r\nflung all her things, her linen and her clothes, all pell-mell, without\r\nfolding it up and packing it. And a heavy shower of rain came on, too,\r\nand Dounia, insulted and put to shame, had to drive with a peasant in an\r\nopen cart all the seventeen versts into town. Only think now what answer\r\ncould I have sent to the letter I received from you two months ago and\r\nwhat could I have written? I was in despair; I dared not write to\r\nyou the truth because you would have been very unhappy, mortified\r\nand indignant, and yet what could you do? You could only perhaps ruin\r\nyourself, and, besides, Dounia would not allow it; and fill up my letter\r\nwith trifles when my heart was so full of sorrow, I could not. For a\r\nwhole month the town was full of gossip about this scandal, and it came\r\nto such a pass that Dounia and I dared not even go to church on account\r\nof the contemptuous looks, whispers, and even remarks made aloud about\r\nus. All our acquaintances avoided us, nobody even bowed to us in the\r\nstreet, and I learnt that some shopmen and clerks were intending to\r\ninsult us in a shameful way, smearing the gates of our house with pitch,\r\nso that the landlord began to tell us we must leave. All this was set\r\ngoing by Marfa Petrovna who managed to slander Dounia and throw dirt at\r\nher in every family. She knows everyone in the neighbourhood, and that\r\nmonth she was continually coming into the town, and as she is\r\nrather talkative and fond of gossiping about her family affairs and\r\nparticularly of complaining to all and each of her husband--which is not\r\nat all right--so in a short time she had spread her story not only in\r\nthe town, but over the whole surrounding district. It made me ill, but\r\nDounia bore it better than I did, and if only you could have seen how\r\nshe endured it all and tried to comfort me and cheer me up! She is\r\nan angel! But by God\xe2\x80\x99s mercy, our sufferings were cut short: Mr.\r\nSvidriga\xc3\xaflov returned to his senses and repented and, probably\r\nfeeling sorry for Dounia, he laid before Marfa Petrovna a complete and\r\nunmistakable proof of Dounia\xe2\x80\x99s innocence, in the form of a letter Dounia\r\nhad been forced to write and give to him, before Marfa Petrovna\r\ncame upon them in the garden. This letter, which remained in Mr.\r\nSvidriga\xc3\xaflov\xe2\x80\x99s hands after her departure, she had written to refuse\r\npersonal explanations and secret interviews, for which he was entreating\r\nher. In that letter she reproached him with great heat and indignation\r\nfor the baseness of his behaviour in regard to Marfa Petrovna, reminding\r\nhim that he was the father and head of a family and telling him how\r\ninfamous it was of him to torment and make unhappy a defenceless girl,\r\nunhappy enough already. Indeed, dear Rodya, the letter was so nobly and\r\ntouchingly written that I sobbed when I read it and to this day I cannot\r\nread it without tears. Moreover, the evidence of the servants, too,\r\ncleared Dounia\xe2\x80\x99s reputation; they had seen and known a great deal more\r\nthan Mr. Svidriga\xc3\xaflov had himself supposed--as indeed is always the case\r\nwith servants. Marfa Petrovna was completely taken aback, and \xe2\x80\x98again\r\ncrushed\xe2\x80\x99 as she said herself to us, but she was completely convinced of\r\nDounia\xe2\x80\x99s innocence. The very next day, being Sunday, she went straight\r\nto the Cathedral, knelt down and prayed with tears to Our Lady to give\r\nher strength to bear this new trial and to do her duty. Then she\r\ncame straight from the Cathedral to us, told us the whole story, wept\r\nbitterly and, fully penitent, she embraced Dounia and besought her to\r\nforgive her. The same morning without any delay, she went round to all\r\nthe houses in the town and everywhere, shedding tears, she asserted in\r\nthe most flattering terms Dounia\xe2\x80\x99s innocence and the nobility of\r\nher feelings and her behavior. What was more, she showed and read to\r\neveryone the letter in Dounia\xe2\x80\x99s own handwriting to Mr. Svidriga\xc3\xaflov and\r\neven allowed them to take copies of it--which I must say I think was\r\nsuperfluous. In this way she was busy for several days in driving about\r\nthe whole town, because some people had taken offence through precedence\r\nhaving been given to others. And therefore they had to take turns, so\r\nthat in every house she was expected before she arrived, and everyone\r\nknew that on such and such a day Marfa Petrovna would be reading the\r\nletter in such and such a place and people assembled for every reading\r\nof it, even many who had heard it several times already both in their\r\nown houses and in other people\xe2\x80\x99s. In my opinion a great deal, a very\r\ngreat deal of all this was unnecessary; but that\xe2\x80\x99s Marfa Petrovna\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncharacter. Anyway she succeeded in completely re-establishing Dounia\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nreputation and the whole ignominy of this affair rested as an indelible\r\ndisgrace upon her husband, as the only person to blame, so that I really\r\nbegan to feel sorry for him; it was really treating the crazy fellow too\r\nharshly. Dounia was at once asked to give lessons in several families,\r\nbut she refused. All of a sudden everyone began to treat her with marked\r\nrespect and all this did much to bring about the event by which, one may\r\nsay, our whole fortunes are now transformed. You must know, dear Rodya,\r\nthat Dounia has a suitor and that she has already consented to marry\r\nhim. I hasten to tell you all about the matter, and though it has been\r\narranged without asking your consent, I think you will not be aggrieved\r\nwith me or with your sister on that account, for you will see that we\r\ncould not wait and put off our decision till we heard from you. And you\r\ncould not have judged all the facts without being on the spot. This\r\nwas how it happened. He is already of the rank of a counsellor, Pyotr\r\nPetrovitch Luzhin, and is distantly related to Marfa Petrovna, who\r\nhas been very active in bringing the match about. It began with his\r\nexpressing through her his desire to make our acquaintance. He was\r\nproperly received, drank coffee with us and the very next day he sent\r\nus a letter in which he very courteously made an offer and begged for a\r\nspeedy and decided answer. He is a very busy man and is in a great hurry\r\nto get to Petersburg, so that every moment is precious to him. At first,\r\nof course, we were greatly surprised, as it had all happened so quickly\r\nand unexpectedly. We thought and talked it over the whole day. He is a\r\nwell-to-do man, to be depended upon, he has two posts in the government\r\nand has already made his fortune. It is true that he is forty-five years\r\nold, but he is of a fairly prepossessing appearance and might still be\r\nthought attractive by women, and he is altogether a very respectable and\r\npresentable man, only he seems a little morose and somewhat conceited.\r\nBut possibly that may only be the impression he makes at first sight.\r\nAnd beware, dear Rodya, when he comes to Petersburg, as he shortly will\r\ndo, beware of judging him too hastily and severely, as your way is, if\r\nthere is anything you do not like in him at first sight. I give you this\r\nwarning, although I feel sure that he will make a favourable impression\r\nupon you. Moreover, in order to understand any man one must be\r\ndeliberate and careful to avoid forming prejudices and mistaken ideas,\r\nwhich are very difficult to correct and get over afterwards. And Pyotr\r\nPetrovitch, judging by many indications, is a thoroughly estimable man.\r\nAt his first visit, indeed, he told us that he was a practical man, but\r\nstill he shares, as he expressed it, many of the convictions \xe2\x80\x98of our\r\nmost rising generation\xe2\x80\x99 and he is an opponent of all prejudices. He\r\nsaid a good deal more, for he seems a little conceited and likes to be\r\nlistened to, but this is scarcely a vice. I, of course, understood very\r\nlittle of it, but Dounia explained to me that, though he is not a man\r\nof great education, he is clever and seems to be good-natured. You know\r\nyour sister\xe2\x80\x99s character, Rodya. She is a resolute, sensible, patient and\r\ngenerous girl, but she has a passionate heart, as I know very well.\r\nOf course, there is no great love either on his side, or on hers, but\r\nDounia is a clever girl and has the heart of an angel, and will make\r\nit her duty to make her husband happy who on his side will make her\r\nhappiness his care. Of that we have no good reason to doubt, though it\r\nmust be admitted the matter has been arranged in great haste. Besides he\r\nis a man of great prudence and he will see, to be sure, of himself, that\r\nhis own happiness will be the more secure, the happier Dounia is with\r\nhim. And as for some defects of character, for some habits and even\r\ncertain differences of opinion--which indeed are inevitable even in\r\nthe happiest marriages--Dounia has said that, as regards all that, she\r\nrelies on herself, that there is nothing to be uneasy about, and\r\nthat she is ready to put up with a great deal, if only their future\r\nrelationship can be an honourable and straightforward one. He struck me,\r\nfor instance, at first, as rather abrupt, but that may well come\r\nfrom his being an outspoken man, and that is no doubt how it is. For\r\ninstance, at his second visit, after he had received Dounia\xe2\x80\x99s consent,\r\nin the course of conversation, he declared that before making\r\nDounia\xe2\x80\x99s acquaintance, he had made up his mind to marry a girl of\r\ngood reputation, without dowry and, above all, one who had experienced\r\npoverty, because, as he explained, a man ought not to be indebted to his\r\nwife, but that it is better for a wife to look upon her husband as her\r\nbenefactor. I must add that he expressed it more nicely and politely\r\nthan I have done, for I have forgotten his actual phrases and only\r\nremember the meaning. And, besides, it was obviously not said of design,\r\nbut slipped out in the heat of conversation, so that he tried afterwards\r\nto correct himself and smooth it over, but all the same it did strike\r\nme as somewhat rude, and I said so afterwards to Dounia. But Dounia was\r\nvexed, and answered that \xe2\x80\x98words are not deeds,\xe2\x80\x99 and that, of course, is\r\nperfectly true. Dounia did not sleep all night before she made up\r\nher mind, and, thinking that I was asleep, she got out of bed and was\r\nwalking up and down the room all night; at last she knelt down before\r\nthe ikon and prayed long and fervently and in the morning she told me\r\nthat she had decided.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have mentioned already that Pyotr Petrovitch is just setting off for\r\nPetersburg, where he has a great deal of business, and he wants to open\r\na legal bureau. He has been occupied for many years in conducting civil\r\nand commercial litigation, and only the other day he won an important\r\ncase. He has to be in Petersburg because he has an important case before\r\nthe Senate. So, Rodya dear, he may be of the greatest use to you, in\r\nevery way indeed, and Dounia and I have agreed that from this very day\r\nyou could definitely enter upon your career and might consider that\r\nyour future is marked out and assured for you. Oh, if only this comes to\r\npass! This would be such a benefit that we could only look upon it as a\r\nprovidential blessing. Dounia is dreaming of nothing else. We have even\r\nventured already to drop a few words on the subject to Pyotr Petrovitch.\r\nHe was cautious in his answer, and said that, of course, as he could not\r\nget on without a secretary, it would be better to be paying a salary to\r\na relation than to a stranger, if only the former were fitted for the\r\nduties (as though there could be doubt of your being fitted!) but then\r\nhe expressed doubts whether your studies at the university would leave\r\nyou time for work at his office. The matter dropped for the time, but\r\nDounia is thinking of nothing else now. She has been in a sort of fever\r\nfor the last few days, and has already made a regular plan for\r\nyour becoming in the end an associate and even a partner in Pyotr\r\nPetrovitch\xe2\x80\x99s business, which might well be, seeing that you are a\r\nstudent of law. I am in complete agreement with her, Rodya, and share\r\nall her plans and hopes, and think there is every probability of\r\nrealising them. And in spite of Pyotr Petrovitch\xe2\x80\x99s evasiveness, very\r\nnatural at present (since he does not know you), Dounia is firmly\r\npersuaded that she will gain everything by her good influence over her\r\nfuture husband; this she is reckoning upon. Of course we are careful\r\nnot to talk of any of these more remote plans to Pyotr Petrovitch,\r\nespecially of your becoming his partner. He is a practical man and might\r\ntake this very coldly, it might all seem to him simply a day-dream. Nor\r\nhas either Dounia or I breathed a word to him of the great hopes we have\r\nof his helping us to pay for your university studies; we have not spoken\r\nof it in the first place, because it will come to pass of itself,\r\nlater on, and he will no doubt without wasting words offer to do it of\r\nhimself, (as though he could refuse Dounia that) the more readily since\r\nyou may by your own efforts become his right hand in the office, and\r\nreceive this assistance not as a charity, but as a salary earned by your\r\nown work. Dounia wants to arrange it all like this and I quite agree\r\nwith her. And we have not spoken of our plans for another reason, that\r\nis, because I particularly wanted you to feel on an equal footing when\r\nyou first meet him. When Dounia spoke to him with enthusiasm about\r\nyou, he answered that one could never judge of a man without seeing\r\nhim close, for oneself, and that he looked forward to forming his own\r\nopinion when he makes your acquaintance. Do you know, my precious\r\nRodya, I think that perhaps for some reasons (nothing to do with Pyotr\r\nPetrovitch though, simply for my own personal, perhaps old-womanish,\r\nfancies) I should do better to go on living by myself, apart, than with\r\nthem, after the wedding. I am convinced that he will be generous and\r\ndelicate enough to invite me and to urge me to remain with my daughter\r\nfor the future, and if he has said nothing about it hitherto, it is\r\nsimply because it has been taken for granted; but I shall refuse. I have\r\nnoticed more than once in my life that husbands don\xe2\x80\x99t quite get on with\r\ntheir mothers-in-law, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be the least bit in anyone\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nway, and for my own sake, too, would rather be quite independent, so\r\nlong as I have a crust of bread of my own, and such children as you and\r\nDounia. If possible, I would settle somewhere near you, for the most\r\njoyful piece of news, dear Rodya, I have kept for the end of my letter:\r\nknow then, my dear boy, that we may, perhaps, be all together in a\r\nvery short time and may embrace one another again after a separation of\r\nalmost three years! It is settled _for certain_ that Dounia and I are to\r\nset off for Petersburg, exactly when I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, but very, very soon,\r\npossibly in a week. It all depends on Pyotr Petrovitch who will let us\r\nknow when he has had time to look round him in Petersburg. To suit his\r\nown arrangements he is anxious to have the ceremony as soon as possible,\r\neven before the fast of Our Lady, if it could be managed, or if that is\r\ntoo soon to be ready, immediately after. Oh, with what happiness I shall\r\npress you to my heart! Dounia is all excitement at the joyful thought\r\nof seeing you, she said one day in joke that she would be ready to marry\r\nPyotr Petrovitch for that alone. She is an angel! She is not writing\r\nanything to you now, and has only told me to write that she has so much,\r\nso much to tell you that she is not going to take up her pen now, for\r\na few lines would tell you nothing, and it would only mean upsetting\r\nherself; she bids me send you her love and innumerable kisses. But\r\nalthough we shall be meeting so soon, perhaps I shall send you as much\r\nmoney as I can in a day or two. Now that everyone has heard that Dounia\r\nis to marry Pyotr Petrovitch, my credit has suddenly improved and I know\r\nthat Afanasy Ivanovitch will trust me now even to seventy-five roubles\r\non the security of my pension, so that perhaps I shall be able to send\r\nyou twenty-five or even thirty roubles. I would send you more, but I am\r\nuneasy about our travelling expenses; for though Pyotr Petrovitch has\r\nbeen so kind as to undertake part of the expenses of the journey, that\r\nis to say, he has taken upon himself the conveyance of our bags and big\r\ntrunk (which will be conveyed through some acquaintances of his), we\r\nmust reckon upon some expense on our arrival in Petersburg, where we\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t be left without a halfpenny, at least for the first few days. But\r\nwe have calculated it all, Dounia and I, to the last penny, and we see\r\nthat the journey will not cost very much. It is only ninety versts from\r\nus to the railway and we have come to an agreement with a driver we\r\nknow, so as to be in readiness; and from there Dounia and I can travel\r\nquite comfortably third class. So that I may very likely be able to send\r\nto you not twenty-five, but thirty roubles. But enough; I have covered\r\ntwo sheets already and there is no space left for more; our whole\r\nhistory, but so many events have happened! And now, my precious Rodya,\r\nI embrace you and send you a mother\xe2\x80\x99s blessing till we meet. Love Dounia\r\nyour sister, Rodya; love her as she loves you and understand that she\r\nloves you beyond everything, more than herself. She is an angel and you,\r\nRodya, you are everything to us--our one hope, our one consolation. If\r\nonly you are happy, we shall be happy. Do you still say your prayers,\r\nRodya, and believe in the mercy of our Creator and our Redeemer? I am\r\nafraid in my heart that you may have been visited by the new spirit of\r\ninfidelity that is abroad to-day; If it is so, I pray for you. Remember,\r\ndear boy, how in your childhood, when your father was living, you used\r\nto lisp your prayers at my knee, and how happy we all were in those\r\ndays. Good-bye, till we meet then--I embrace you warmly, warmly, with\r\nmany kisses.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYours till death,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPULCHERIA RASKOLNIKOV.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nAlmost from the first, while he read the letter, Raskolnikov\xe2\x80\x99s face was\r\nwet with tears; but when he finished it, his face was pale and distorted\r\nand a bitter, wrathful and malignant smile was on his lips. He laid his\r\nhead down on his threadbare dirty pillow and pondered, pondered a long\r\ntime. His heart was beating violently, and his brain was in a turmoil.\r\nAt last he felt cramped and stifled in the little yellow room that was\r\nlike a cupboard or a box. His eyes and his mind craved for space. He\r\ntook up his hat and went out, this time without dread of meeting\r\nanyone; he had forgotten his dread. He turned in the direction of the\r\nVassilyevsky Ostrov, walking along Vassilyevsky Prospect, as though\r\nhastening on some business, but he walked, as his habit was, without\r\nnoticing his way, muttering and even speaking aloud to himself, to the\r\nastonishment of the passers-by. Many of them took him to be drunk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nHis mother\xe2\x80\x99s letter had been a torture to him, but as regards the chief\r\nfact in it, he had felt not one moment\xe2\x80\x99s hesitation, even whilst he was\r\nreading the letter. The essential question was settled, and irrevocably\r\nsettled, in his mind: \xe2\x80\x9cNever such a marriage while I am alive and\r\nMr. Luzhin be damned!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThe thing is perfectly clear,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered\r\nto himself, with a malignant smile anticipating the triumph of his\r\ndecision. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, mother, no, Dounia, you won\xe2\x80\x99t deceive me! and then they\r\napologise for not asking my advice and for taking the decision without\r\nme! I dare say! They imagine it is arranged now and can\xe2\x80\x99t be broken\r\noff; but we will see whether it can or not! A magnificent excuse:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pyotr Petrovitch is such a busy man that even his wedding has to be in\r\npost-haste, almost by express.\xe2\x80\x99 No, Dounia, I see it all and I know what\r\nyou want to say to me; and I know too what you were thinking about, when\r\nyou walked up and down all night, and what your prayers were like before\r\nthe Holy Mother of Kazan who stands in mother\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom. Bitter is\r\nthe ascent to Golgotha.... Hm... so it is finally settled; you have\r\ndetermined to marry a sensible business man, Avdotya Romanovna, one\r\nwho has a fortune (has _already_ made his fortune, that is so much\r\nmore solid and impressive), a man who holds two government posts and who\r\nshares the ideas of our most rising generation, as mother writes, and\r\nwho _seems_ to be kind, as Dounia herself observes. That _seems_ beats\r\neverything! And that very Dounia for that very \xe2\x80\x98_seems_\xe2\x80\x99 is marrying\r\nhim! Splendid! splendid!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c... But I should like to know why mother has written to me about \xe2\x80\x98our\r\nmost rising generation\xe2\x80\x99? Simply as a descriptive touch, or with the idea\r\nof prepossessing me in favour of Mr. Luzhin? Oh, the cunning of them!\r\nI should like to know one thing more: how far they were open with one\r\nanother that day and night and all this time since? Was it all put into\r\n_words_, or did both understand that they had the same thing at heart\r\nand in their minds, so that there was no need to speak of it aloud, and\r\nbetter not to speak of it. Most likely it was partly like that, from\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s letter it\xe2\x80\x99s evident: he struck her as rude _a little_, and\r\nmother in her simplicity took her observations to Dounia. And she was\r\nsure to be vexed and \xe2\x80\x98answered her angrily.\xe2\x80\x99 I should think so! Who\r\nwould not be angered when it was quite clear without any na\xc3\xafve questions\r\nand when it was understood that it was useless to discuss it. And why\r\ndoes she write to me, \xe2\x80\x98love Dounia, Rodya, and she loves you more than\r\nherself\xe2\x80\x99? Has she a secret conscience-prick at sacrificing her daughter\r\nto her son? \xe2\x80\x98You are our one comfort, you are everything to us.\xe2\x80\x99 Oh,\r\nmother!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis bitterness grew more and more intense, and if he had happened to\r\nmeet Mr. Luzhin at the moment, he might have murdered him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHm... yes, that\xe2\x80\x99s true,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, pursuing the whirling ideas that\r\nchased each other in his brain, \xe2\x80\x9cit is true that \xe2\x80\x98it needs time and care\r\nto get to know a man,\xe2\x80\x99 but there is no mistake about Mr. Luzhin. The\r\nchief thing is he is \xe2\x80\x98a man of business and _seems_ kind,\xe2\x80\x99 that was\r\nsomething, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it, to send the bags and big box for them! A kind man,\r\nno doubt after that! But his _bride_ and her mother are to drive in a\r\npeasant\xe2\x80\x99s cart covered with sacking (I know, I have been driven in\r\nit). No matter! It is only ninety versts and then they can \xe2\x80\x98travel very\r\ncomfortably, third class,\xe2\x80\x99 for a thousand versts! Quite right, too. One\r\nmust cut one\xe2\x80\x99s coat according to one\xe2\x80\x99s cloth, but what about you, Mr.\r\nLuzhin? She is your bride.... And you must be aware that her mother has\r\nto raise money on her pension for the journey. To be sure it\xe2\x80\x99s a matter\r\nof business, a partnership for mutual benefit, with equal shares and\r\nexpenses;--food and drink provided, but pay for your tobacco. The\r\nbusiness man has got the better of them, too. The luggage will cost less\r\nthan their fares and very likely go for nothing. How is it that they\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t both see all that, or is it that they don\xe2\x80\x99t want to see? And\r\nthey are pleased, pleased! And to think that this is only the first\r\nblossoming, and that the real fruits are to come! But what really\r\nmatters is not the stinginess, is not the meanness, but the _tone_\r\nof the whole thing. For that will be the tone after marriage, it\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nforetaste of it. And mother too, why should she be so lavish? What will\r\nshe have by the time she gets to Petersburg? Three silver roubles or\r\ntwo \xe2\x80\x98paper ones\xe2\x80\x99 as _she_ says.... that old woman... hm. What does\r\nshe expect to live upon in Petersburg afterwards? She has her reasons\r\nalready for guessing that she _could not_ live with Dounia after the\r\nmarriage, even for the first few months. The good man has no doubt let\r\nslip something on that subject also, though mother would deny it: \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nshall refuse,\xe2\x80\x99 says she. On whom is she reckoning then? Is she counting\r\non what is left of her hundred and twenty roubles of pension when\r\nAfanasy Ivanovitch\xe2\x80\x99s debt is paid? She knits woollen shawls and\r\nembroiders cuffs, ruining her old eyes. And all her shawls don\xe2\x80\x99t add\r\nmore than twenty roubles a year to her hundred and twenty, I know\r\nthat. So she is building all her hopes all the time on Mr. Luzhin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngenerosity; \xe2\x80\x98he will offer it of himself, he will press it on me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nYou may wait a long time for that! That\xe2\x80\x99s how it always is with these\r\nSchilleresque noble hearts; till the last moment every goose is a swan\r\nwith them, till the last moment, they hope for the best and will see\r\nnothing wrong, and although they have an inkling of the other side of\r\nthe picture, yet they won\xe2\x80\x99t face the truth till they are forced to; the\r\nvery thought of it makes them shiver; they thrust the truth away with\r\nboth hands, until the man they deck out in false colours puts a fool\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncap on them with his own hands. I should like to know whether Mr. Luzhin\r\nhas any orders of merit; I bet he has the Anna in his buttonhole and\r\nthat he puts it on when he goes to dine with contractors or merchants.\r\nHe will be sure to have it for his wedding, too! Enough of him, confound\r\nhim!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,... mother I don\xe2\x80\x99t wonder at, it\xe2\x80\x99s like her, God bless her, but\r\nhow could Dounia? Dounia darling, as though I did not know you! You were\r\nnearly twenty when I saw you last: I understood you then. Mother writes\r\nthat \xe2\x80\x98Dounia can put up with a great deal.\xe2\x80\x99 I know that very well. I\r\nknew that two years and a half ago, and for the last two and a half\r\nyears I have been thinking about it, thinking of just that, that \xe2\x80\x98Dounia\r\ncan put up with a great deal.\xe2\x80\x99 If she could put up with Mr. Svidriga\xc3\xaflov\r\nand all the rest of it, she certainly can put up with a great deal. And\r\nnow mother and she have taken it into their heads that she can put up\r\nwith Mr. Luzhin, who propounds the theory of the superiority of\r\nwives raised from destitution and owing everything to their husband\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbounty--who propounds it, too, almost at the first interview. Granted\r\nthat he \xe2\x80\x98let it slip,\xe2\x80\x99 though he is a sensible man, (yet maybe it\r\nwas not a slip at all, but he meant to make himself clear as soon as\r\npossible) but Dounia, Dounia? She understands the man, of course, but\r\nshe will have to live with the man. Why! she\xe2\x80\x99d live on black bread\r\nand water, she would not sell her soul, she would not barter her moral\r\nfreedom for comfort; she would not barter it for all Schleswig-Holstein,\r\nmuch less Mr. Luzhin\xe2\x80\x99s money. No, Dounia was not that sort when I knew\r\nher and... she is still the same, of course! Yes, there\xe2\x80\x99s no denying,\r\nthe Svidriga\xc3\xaflovs are a bitter pill! It\xe2\x80\x99s a bitter thing to spend one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlife a governess in the provinces for two hundred roubles, but I know\r\nshe would rather be a nigger on a plantation or a Lett with a German\r\nmaster than degrade her soul, and her moral dignity, by binding herself\r\nfor ever to a man whom she does not respect and with whom she has\r\nnothing in common--for her own advantage. And if Mr. Luzhin had been of\r\nunalloyed gold, or one huge diamond, she would never have consented to\r\nbecome his legal concubine. Why is she consenting then? What\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\npoint of it? What\xe2\x80\x99s the answer? It\xe2\x80\x99s clear enough: for herself, for her\r\ncomfort, to save her life she would not sell herself, but for someone\r\nelse she is doing it! For one she loves, for one she adores, she will\r\nsell herself! That\xe2\x80\x99s what it all amounts to; for her brother, for her\r\nmother, she will sell herself! She will sell everything! In such cases,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98we overcome our moral feeling if necessary,\xe2\x80\x99 freedom, peace, conscience\r\neven, all, all are brought into the market. Let my life go, if only my\r\ndear ones may be happy! More than that, we become casuists, we learn\r\nto be Jesuitical and for a time maybe we can soothe ourselves, we can\r\npersuade ourselves that it is one\xe2\x80\x99s duty for a good object. That\xe2\x80\x99s just\r\nlike us, it\xe2\x80\x99s as clear as daylight. It\xe2\x80\x99s clear that Rodion Romanovitch\r\nRaskolnikov is the central figure in the business, and no one else. Oh,\r\nyes, she can ensure his happiness, keep him in the university, make him\r\na partner in the office, make his whole future secure; perhaps he may\r\neven be a rich man later on, prosperous, respected, and may even end his\r\nlife a famous man! But my mother? It\xe2\x80\x99s all Rodya, precious Rodya, her\r\nfirst born! For such a son who would not sacrifice such a daughter! Oh,\r\nloving, over-partial hearts! Why, for his sake we would not shrink even\r\nfrom Sonia\xe2\x80\x99s fate. Sonia, Sonia Marmeladov, the eternal victim so long\r\nas the world lasts. Have you taken the measure of your sacrifice, both\r\nof you? Is it right? Can you bear it? Is it any use? Is there sense in\r\nit? And let me tell you, Dounia, Sonia\xe2\x80\x99s life is no worse than life with\r\nMr. Luzhin. \xe2\x80\x98There can be no question of love,\xe2\x80\x99 mother writes. And what\r\nif there can be no respect either, if on the contrary there is aversion,\r\ncontempt, repulsion, what then? So you will have to \xe2\x80\x98keep up your\r\nappearance,\xe2\x80\x99 too. Is not that so? Do you understand what that smartness\r\nmeans? Do you understand that the Luzhin smartness is just the same\r\nthing as Sonia\xe2\x80\x99s and may be worse, viler, baser, because in your case,\r\nDounia, it\xe2\x80\x99s a bargain for luxuries, after all, but with Sonia it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsimply a question of starvation. It has to be paid for, it has to be\r\npaid for, Dounia, this smartness. And what if it\xe2\x80\x99s more than you can\r\nbear afterwards, if you regret it? The bitterness, the misery, the\r\ncurses, the tears hidden from all the world, for you are not a Marfa\r\nPetrovna. And how will your mother feel then? Even now she is uneasy,\r\nshe is worried, but then, when she sees it all clearly? And I? Yes,\r\nindeed, what have you taken me for? I won\xe2\x80\x99t have your sacrifice, Dounia,\r\nI won\xe2\x80\x99t have it, mother! It shall not be, so long as I am alive, it\r\nshall not, it shall not! I won\xe2\x80\x99t accept it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe suddenly paused in his reflection and stood still.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt shall not be? But what are you going to do to prevent it? You\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nforbid it? And what right have you? What can you promise them on your\r\nside to give you such a right? Your whole life, your whole future, you\r\nwill devote to them _when you have finished your studies and obtained a\r\npost_? Yes, we have heard all that before, and that\xe2\x80\x99s all _words_, but\r\nnow? Now something must be done, now, do you understand that? And\r\nwhat are you doing now? You are living upon them. They borrow on their\r\nhundred roubles pension. They borrow from the Svidriga\xc3\xaflovs. How are\r\nyou going to save them from Svidriga\xc3\xaflovs, from Afanasy Ivanovitch\r\nVahrushin, oh, future millionaire Zeus who would arrange their lives for\r\nthem? In another ten years? In another ten years, mother will be blind\r\nwith knitting shawls, maybe with weeping too. She will be worn to a\r\nshadow with fasting; and my sister? Imagine for a moment what may have\r\nbecome of your sister in ten years? What may happen to her during those\r\nten years? Can you fancy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo he tortured himself, fretting himself with such questions, and\r\nfinding a kind of enjoyment in it. And yet all these questions were not\r\nnew ones suddenly confronting him, they were old familiar aches. It was\r\nlong since they had first begun to grip and rend his heart. Long, long\r\nago his present anguish had its first beginnings; it had waxed and\r\ngathered strength, it had matured and concentrated, until it had taken\r\nthe form of a fearful, frenzied and fantastic question, which tortured\r\nhis heart and mind, clamouring insistently for an answer. Now his\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s letter had burst on him like a thunderclap. It was clear\r\nthat he must not now suffer passively, worrying himself over unsolved\r\nquestions, but that he must do something, do it at once, and do it\r\nquickly. Anyway he must decide on something, or else...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr throw up life altogether!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried suddenly, in a frenzy--\xe2\x80\x9caccept\r\none\xe2\x80\x99s lot humbly as it is, once for all and stifle everything in\r\noneself, giving up all claim to activity, life and love!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you understand, sir, do you understand what it means when you have\r\nabsolutely nowhere to turn?\xe2\x80\x9d Marmeladov\xe2\x80\x99s question came suddenly into\r\nhis mind, \xe2\x80\x9cfor every man must have somewhere to turn....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe gave a sudden start; another thought, that he had had yesterday,\r\nslipped back into his mind. But he did not start at the thought\r\nrecurring to him, for he knew, he had _felt beforehand_, that it must\r\ncome back, he was expecting it; besides it was not only yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthought. The difference was that a month ago, yesterday even, the\r\nthought was a mere dream: but now... now it appeared not a dream at all,\r\nit had taken a new menacing and quite unfamiliar shape, and he suddenly\r\nbecame aware of this himself.... He felt a hammering in his head, and\r\nthere was a darkness before his eyes.\r\n\r\nHe looked round hurriedly, he was searching for something. He wanted\r\nto sit down and was looking for a seat; he was walking along the K----\r\nBoulevard. There was a seat about a hundred paces in front of him. He\r\nwalked towards it as fast he could; but on the way he met with a little\r\nadventure which absorbed all his attention. Looking for the seat, he had\r\nnoticed a woman walking some twenty paces in front of him, but at first\r\nhe took no more notice of her than of other objects that crossed his\r\npath. It had happened to him many times going home not to notice the\r\nroad by which he was going, and he was accustomed to walk like that. But\r\nthere was at first sight something so strange about the woman in front\r\nof him, that gradually his attention was riveted upon her, at first\r\nreluctantly and, as it were, resentfully, and then more and more\r\nintently. He felt a sudden desire to find out what it was that was so\r\nstrange about the woman. In the first place, she appeared to be a girl\r\nquite young, and she was walking in the great heat bareheaded and with\r\nno parasol or gloves, waving her arms about in an absurd way. She had\r\non a dress of some light silky material, but put on strangely awry, not\r\nproperly hooked up, and torn open at the top of the skirt, close to the\r\nwaist: a great piece was rent and hanging loose. A little kerchief was\r\nflung about her bare throat, but lay slanting on one side. The girl was\r\nwalking unsteadily, too, stumbling and staggering from side to side. She\r\ndrew Raskolnikov\xe2\x80\x99s whole attention at last. He overtook the girl at the\r\nseat, but, on reaching it, she dropped down on it, in the corner;\r\nshe let her head sink on the back of the seat and closed her eyes,\r\napparently in extreme exhaustion. Looking at her closely, he saw at once\r\nthat she was completely drunk. It was a strange and shocking sight. He\r\ncould hardly believe that he was not mistaken. He saw before him the\r\nface of a quite young, fair-haired girl--sixteen, perhaps not more than\r\nfifteen, years old, pretty little face, but flushed and heavy looking\r\nand, as it were, swollen. The girl seemed hardly to know what she was\r\ndoing; she crossed one leg over the other, lifting it indecorously, and\r\nshowed every sign of being unconscious that she was in the street.\r\n\r\nRaskolnikov did not sit down, but he felt unwilling to leave her,\r\nand stood facing her in perplexity. This boulevard was never much\r\nfrequented; and now, at two o\xe2\x80\x99clock, in the stifling heat, it was quite\r\ndeserted. And yet on the further side of the boulevard, about fifteen\r\npaces away, a gentleman was standing on the edge of the pavement. He,\r\ntoo, would apparently have liked to approach the girl with some object\r\nof his own. He, too, had probably seen her in the distance and had\r\nfollowed her, but found Raskolnikov in his way. He looked angrily at\r\nhim, though he tried to escape his notice, and stood impatiently biding\r\nhis time, till the unwelcome man in rags should have moved away. His\r\nintentions were unmistakable. The gentleman was a plump, thickly-set\r\nman, about thirty, fashionably dressed, with a high colour, red lips and\r\nmoustaches. Raskolnikov felt furious; he had a sudden longing to insult\r\nthis fat dandy in some way. He left the girl for a moment and walked\r\ntowards the gentleman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHey! You Svidriga\xc3\xaflov! What do you want here?\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted, clenching\r\nhis fists and laughing, spluttering with rage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d the gentleman asked sternly, scowling in haughty\r\nastonishment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet away, that\xe2\x80\x99s what I mean.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow dare you, you low fellow!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe raised his cane. Raskolnikov rushed at him with his fists, without\r\nreflecting that the stout gentleman was a match for two men like\r\nhimself. But at that instant someone seized him from behind, and a\r\npolice constable stood between them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s enough, gentlemen, no fighting, please, in a public place. What\r\ndo you want? Who are you?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked Raskolnikov sternly, noticing his\r\nrags.\r\n\r\nRaskolnikov looked at him intently. He had a straight-forward, sensible,\r\nsoldierly face, with grey moustaches and whiskers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are just the man I want,\xe2\x80\x9d Raskolnikov cried, catching at his arm.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am a student, Raskolnikov.... You may as well know that too,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nadded, addressing the gentleman, \xe2\x80\x9ccome along, I have something to show\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd taking the policeman by the hand he drew him towards the seat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here, hopelessly drunk, and she has just come down the boulevard.\r\nThere is no telling who and what she is, she does not look like a\r\nprofessional. It\xe2\x80\x99s more likely she has been given drink and deceived\r\nsomewhere... for the first time... you understand? and they\xe2\x80\x99ve put her\r\nout into the street like that. Look at the way her dress is torn, and\r\nthe way it has been put on: she has been dressed by somebody, she has\r\nnot dressed herself, and dressed by unpractised hands, by a man\xe2\x80\x99s hands;\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s evident. And now look there: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that dandy with whom I\r\nwas going to fight, I see him for the first time, but he, too, has seen\r\nher on the road, just now, drunk, not knowing what she is doing, and now\r\nhe is very eager to get hold of her, to get her away somewhere while she\r\nis in this state... that\xe2\x80\x99s certain, believe me, I am not wrong. I saw\r\nhim myself watching her and following her, but I prevented him, and he\r\nis just waiting for me to go away. Now he has walked away a little, and\r\nis standing still, pretending to make a cigarette.... Think how can we\r\nkeep her out of his hands, and how are we to get her home?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe policeman saw it all in a flash. The stout gentleman was easy to\r\nunderstand, he turned to consider the girl. The policeman bent over to\r\nexamine her more closely, and his face worked with genuine compassion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, what a pity!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, shaking his head--\xe2\x80\x9cwhy, she is quite a\r\nchild! She has been deceived, you can see that at once. Listen, lady,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he began addressing her, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere do you live?\xe2\x80\x9d The girl opened her weary\r\nand sleepy-looking eyes, gazed blankly at the speaker and waved her\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere,\xe2\x80\x9d said Raskolnikov feeling in his pocket and finding twenty\r\ncopecks, \xe2\x80\x9chere, call a cab and tell him to drive her to her address. The\r\nonly thing is to find out her address!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMissy, missy!\xe2\x80\x9d the policeman began again, taking the money. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll fetch\r\nyou a cab and take you home myself. Where shall I take you, eh? Where do\r\nyou live?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo away! They won\xe2\x80\x99t let me alone,\xe2\x80\x9d the girl muttered, and once more\r\nwaved her hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAch, ach, how shocking! It\xe2\x80\x99s shameful, missy, it\xe2\x80\x99s a shame!\xe2\x80\x9d He shook\r\nhis head again, shocked, sympathetic and indignant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a difficult job,\xe2\x80\x9d the policeman said to Raskolnikov, and as he\r\ndid so, he looked him up and down in a rapid glance. He, too, must have\r\nseemed a strange figure to him: dressed in rags and handing him money!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you meet her far from here?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you she was walking in front of me, staggering, just here, in\r\nthe boulevard. She only just reached the seat and sank down on it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, the shameful things that are done in the world nowadays, God have\r\nmercy on us! An innocent creature like that, drunk already! She has been\r\ndeceived, that\xe2\x80\x99s a sure thing. See how her dress has been torn too....\r\nAh, the vice one sees nowadays! And as likely as not she belongs to\r\ngentlefolk too, poor ones maybe.... There are many like that nowadays.\r\nShe looks refined, too, as though she were a lady,\xe2\x80\x9d and he bent over her\r\nonce more.\r\n\r\nPerhaps he had daughters growing up like that, \xe2\x80\x9clooking like ladies and\r\nrefined\xe2\x80\x9d with pretensions to gentility and smartness....\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe chief thing is,\xe2\x80\x9d Raskolnikov persisted, \xe2\x80\x9cto keep her out of this\r\nscoundrel\xe2\x80\x99s hands! Why should he outrage her! It\xe2\x80\x99s as clear as day what\r\nhe is after; ah, the brute, he is not moving off!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRaskolnikov spoke aloud and pointed to him. The gentleman heard him,\r\nand seemed about to fly into a rage again, but thought better of it, and\r\nconfined himself to a contemptuous look. He then walked slowly another\r\nten paces away and again halted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKeep her out of his hands we can,\xe2\x80\x9d said the constable thoughtfully,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cif only she\xe2\x80\x99d tell us where to take her, but as it is.... Missy, hey,\r\nmissy!\xe2\x80\x9d he bent over her once more.\r\n\r\nShe opened her eyes fully all of a sudden, looked at him intently, as\r\nthough realising something, got up from the seat and walked away in the\r\ndirection from which she had come. \xe2\x80\x9cOh shameful wretches, they won\xe2\x80\x99t let\r\nme alone!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, waving her hand again. She walked quickly, though\r\nstaggering as before. The dandy followed her, but along another avenue,\r\nkeeping his eye on her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be anxious, I won\xe2\x80\x99t let him have her,\xe2\x80\x9d the policeman said\r\nresolutely, and he set off after them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, the vice one sees nowadays!\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated aloud, sighing.\r\n\r\nAt that moment something seemed to sting Raskolnikov; in an instant a\r\ncomplete revulsion of feeling came over him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHey, here!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted after the policeman.\r\n\r\nThe latter turned round.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet them be! What is it to do with you? Let her go! Let him amuse\r\nhimself.\xe2\x80\x9d He pointed at the dandy, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it to do with you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe policeman was bewildered, and stared at him open-eyed. Raskolnikov\r\nlaughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d ejaculated the policeman, with a gesture of contempt, and he\r\nwalked after the dandy and the girl, probably taking Raskolnikov for a\r\nmadman or something even worse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has carried off my twenty copecks,\xe2\x80\x9d Raskolnikov murmured angrily\r\nwhen he was left alone. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, let him take as much from the other\r\nfellow to allow him to have the girl and so let it end. And why did I\r\nwant to interfere? Is it for me to help? Have I any right to help? Let\r\nthem devour each other alive--what is it to me? How did I dare to give him\r\ntwenty copecks? Were they mine?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn spite of those strange words he felt very wretched. He sat down on\r\nthe deserted seat. His thoughts strayed aimlessly.... He found it hard\r\nto fix his mind on anything at that moment. He longed to forget himself\r\naltogether, to forget everything, and then to wake up and begin life\r\nanew....\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor girl!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, looking at the empty corner where she had\r\nsat--\xe2\x80\x9cShe will come to herself and weep, and then her mother will find\r\nout.... She will give her a beating, a horrible, shameful beating and\r\nthen maybe, turn her out of doors.... And even if she does not, the\r\nDarya Frantsovnas will get wind of it, and the girl will soon be\r\nslipping out on the sly here and there. Then there will be the hospital\r\ndirectly (that\xe2\x80\x99s always the luck of those girls with respectable\r\nmothers, who go wrong on the sly) and then... again the hospital...\r\ndrink... the taverns... and more hospital, in two or three years--a\r\nwreck, and her life over at eighteen or nineteen.... Have not I seen\r\ncases like that? And how have they been brought to it? Why, they\xe2\x80\x99ve all\r\ncome to it like that. Ugh! But what does it matter? That\xe2\x80\x99s as it should\r\nbe, they tell us. A certain percentage, they tell us, must every year\r\ngo... that way... to the devil, I suppose, so that the rest may remain\r\nchaste, and not be interfered with. A percentage! What splendid words\r\nthey have; they are so scientific, so consolatory.... Once you\xe2\x80\x99ve said\r\n\xe2\x80\x98percentage\xe2\x80\x99 there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing more to worry about. If we had any other\r\nword... maybe we might feel more uneasy.... But what if Dounia were one\r\nof the percentage! Of another one if not that one?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut where am I going?\xe2\x80\x9d he thought suddenly. \xe2\x80\x9cStrange, I came out for\r\nsomething. As soon as I had read the letter I came out.... I was going\r\nto Vassilyevsky Ostrov, to Razumihin. That\xe2\x80\x99s what it was... now I\r\nremember. What for, though? And what put the idea of going to Razumihin\r\ninto my head just now? That\xe2\x80\x99s curious.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe wondered at himself. Razumihin was one of his old comrades at the\r\nuniversity. It was remarkable that Raskolnikov had hardly any friends at\r\nthe university; he kept aloof from everyone, went to see no one, and did\r\nnot welcome anyone who came to see him, and indeed everyone soon gave\r\nhim up. He took no part in the students\xe2\x80\x99 gatherings, amusements or\r\nconversations. He worked with great intensity without sparing himself,\r\nand he was respected for this, but no one liked him. He was very poor,\r\nand there was a sort of haughty pride and reserve about him, as though\r\nhe were keeping something to himself. He seemed to some of his comrades\r\nto look down upon them all as children, as though he were superior in\r\ndevelopment, knowledge and convictions, as though their beliefs and\r\ninterests were beneath him.\r\n\r\nWith Razumihin he had got on, or, at least, he was more unreserved and\r\ncommunicative with him. Indeed it was impossible to be on any other\r\nterms with Razumihin. He was an exceptionally good-humoured and candid\r\nyouth, good-natured to the point of simplicity, though both depth and\r\ndignity lay concealed under that simplicity. The better of his comrades\r\nunderstood this, and all were fond of him. He was extremely intelligent,\r\nthough he was certainly rather a simpleton at times. He was of striking\r\nappearance--tall, thin, blackhaired and always badly shaved. He was\r\nsometimes uproarious and was reputed to be of great physical strength.\r\nOne night, when out in a festive company, he had with one blow laid\r\na gigantic policeman on his back. There was no limit to his drinking\r\npowers, but he could abstain from drink altogether; he sometimes went\r\ntoo far in his pranks; but he could do without pranks altogether.\r\nAnother thing striking about Razumihin, no failure distressed him, and\r\nit seemed as though no unfavourable circumstances could crush him. He\r\ncould lodge anywhere, and bear the extremes of cold and hunger. He was\r\nvery poor, and kept himself entirely on what he could earn by work of\r\none sort or another. He knew of no end of resources by which to earn\r\nmoney. He spent one whole winter without lighting his stove, and used to\r\ndeclare that he liked it better, because one slept more soundly in\r\nthe cold. For the present he, too, had been obliged to give up the\r\nuniversity, but it was only for a time, and he was working with all his\r\nmight to save enough to return to his studies again. Raskolnikov had\r\nnot been to see him for the last four months, and Razumihin did not even\r\nknow his address. About two months before, they had met in the street,\r\nbut Raskolnikov had turned away and even crossed to the other side that\r\nhe might not be observed. And though Razumihin noticed him, he passed\r\nhim by, as he did not want to annoy him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been meaning lately to go to Razumihin\xe2\x80\x99s to ask for\r\nwork, to ask him to get me lessons or something...\xe2\x80\x9d Raskolnikov thought,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut what help can he be to me now? Suppose he gets me lessons, suppose\r\nhe shares his last farthing with me, if he has any farthings, so that\r\nI could get some boots and make myself tidy enough to give lessons...\r\nhm... Well and what then? What shall I do with the few coppers I\r\nearn? That\xe2\x80\x99s not what I want now. It\xe2\x80\x99s really absurd for me to go to\r\nRazumihin....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe question why he was now going to Razumihin agitated him even more\r\nthan he was himself aware; he kept uneasily seeking for some sinister\r\nsignificance in this apparently ordinary action.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCould I have expected to set it all straight and to find a way out by\r\nmeans of Razumihin alone?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked himself in perplexity.\r\n\r\nHe pondered and rubbed his forehead, and, strange to say, after long\r\nmusing, suddenly, as if it were spontaneously and by chance, a fantastic\r\nthought came into his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHm... to Razumihin\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x9d he said all at once, calmly, as though he had\r\nreached a final determination. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall go to Razumihin\xe2\x80\x99s of course,\r\nbut... not now. I shall go to him... on the next day after It, when It\r\nwill be over and everything will begin afresh....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd suddenly he realised what he was thinking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter It,\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted, jumping up from the seat, \xe2\x80\x9cbut is It really\r\ngoing to happen? Is it possible it really will happen?\xe2\x80\x9d He left the\r\nseat, and went off almost at a run; he meant to turn back, homewards,\r\nbut the thought of going home suddenly filled him with intense loathing;\r\nin that hole, in that awful little cupboard of his, all _this_ had for a\r\nmonth past been growing up in him; and he walked on at random.\r\n\r\nHis nervous shudder had passed into a fever that made him feel\r\nshivering; in spite of the heat he felt cold. With a kind of effort he\r\nbegan almost unconsciously, from some inner craving, to stare at all\r\nthe objects before him, as though looking for something to distract his\r\nattention; but he did not succeed, and kept dropping every moment into\r\nbrooding. When with a start he lifted his head again and looked round,\r\nhe forgot at once what he had just been thinking about and even where he\r\nwas going. In this way he walked right across Vassilyevsky Ostrov, came\r\nout on to the Lesser Neva, crossed the bridge and turned towards the\r\nislands. The greenness and freshness were at first restful to his weary\r\neyes after the dust of the town and the huge houses that hemmed him in\r\nand weighed upon him. Here there were no taverns, no stifling closeness,\r\nno stench. But soon these new pleasant sensations passed into morbid\r\nirritability. Sometimes he stood still before a brightly painted summer\r\nvilla standing among green foliage, he gazed through the fence, he saw\r\nin the distance smartly dressed women on the verandahs and balconies,\r\nand children running in the gardens. The flowers especially caught his\r\nattention; he gazed at them longer than at anything. He was met, too, by\r\nluxurious carriages and by men and women on horseback; he watched them\r\nwith curious eyes and forgot about them before they had vanished from\r\nhis sight. Once he stood still and counted his money; he found he had\r\nthirty copecks. \xe2\x80\x9cTwenty to the policeman, three to Nastasya for the\r\nletter, so I must have given forty-seven or fifty to the Marmeladovs\r\nyesterday,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, reckoning it up for some unknown reason, but he\r\nsoon forgot with what object he had taken the money out of his pocket.\r\nHe recalled it on passing an eating-house or tavern, and felt that he\r\nwas hungry.... Going into the tavern he drank a glass of vodka and ate a\r\npie of some sort. He finished eating it as he walked away. It was a long\r\nwhile since he had taken vodka and it had an effect upon him at once,\r\nthough he only drank a wineglassful. His legs felt suddenly heavy and\r\na great drowsiness came upon him. He turned homewards, but reaching\r\nPetrovsky Ostrov he stopped completely exhausted, turned off the road\r\ninto the bushes, sank down upon the grass and instantly fell asleep.\r\n\r\nIn a morbid condition of the brain, dreams often have a singular\r\nactuality, vividness, and extraordinary semblance of reality. At times\r\nmonstrous images are created, but the setting and the whole picture are\r\nso truth-like and filled with details so delicate, so unexpectedly, but\r\nso artistically consistent, that the dreamer, were he an artist like\r\nPushkin or Turgenev even, could never have invented them in the waking\r\nstate. Such sick dreams always remain long in the memory and make a\r\npowerful impression on the overwrought and deranged nervous system.\r\n\r\nRaskolnikov had a fearful dream. He dreamt he was back in his childhood\r\nin the little town of his birth. He was a child about seven years old,\r\nwalking into the country with his father on the evening of a holiday. It\r\nwas a grey and heavy day, the country was exactly as he remembered it;\r\nindeed he recalled it far more vividly in his dream than he had done in\r\nmemory. The little town stood on a level flat as bare as the hand, not\r\neven a willow near it; only in the far distance, a copse lay, a dark\r\nblur on the very edge of the horizon. A few paces beyond the last market\r\ngarden stood a tavern, a big tavern, which had always aroused in him a\r\nfeeling of aversion, even of fear, when he walked by it with his father.\r\nThere was always a crowd there, always shouting, laughter and abuse,\r\nhideous hoarse singing and often fighting. Drunken and horrible-looking\r\nfigures were hanging about the tavern. He used to cling close to his\r\nfather, trembling all over when he met them. Near the tavern the road\r\nbecame a dusty track, the dust of which was always black. It was a\r\nwinding road, and about a hundred paces further on, it turned to the\r\nright to the graveyard. In the middle of the graveyard stood a stone\r\nchurch with a green cupola where he used to go to mass two or three\r\ntimes a year with his father and mother, when a service was held in\r\nmemory of his grandmother, who had long been dead, and whom he had never\r\nseen. On these occasions they used to take on a white dish tied up in a\r\ntable napkin a special sort of rice pudding with raisins stuck in it in\r\nthe shape of a cross. He loved that church, the old-fashioned, unadorned\r\nikons and the old priest with the shaking head. Near his grandmother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngrave, which was marked by a stone, was the little grave of his younger\r\nbrother who had died at six months old. He did not remember him at all,\r\nbut he had been told about his little brother, and whenever he visited\r\nthe graveyard he used religiously and reverently to cross himself and\r\nto bow down and kiss the little grave. And now he dreamt that he was\r\nwalking with his father past the tavern on the way to the graveyard; he\r\nwas holding his father\xe2\x80\x99s hand and looking with dread at the tavern. A\r\npeculiar circumstance attracted his attention: there seemed to be\r\nsome kind of festivity going on, there were crowds of gaily dressed\r\ntownspeople, peasant women, their husbands, and riff-raff of all sorts,\r\nall singing and all more or less drunk. Near the entrance of the tavern\r\nstood a cart, but a strange cart. It was one of those big carts usually\r\ndrawn by heavy cart-horses and laden with casks of wine or other heavy\r\ngoods. He always liked looking at those great cart-horses, with their\r\nlong manes, thick legs, and slow even pace, drawing along a perfect\r\nmountain with no appearance of effort, as though it were easier going\r\nwith a load than without it. But now, strange to say, in the shafts of\r\nsuch a cart he saw a thin little sorrel beast, one of those peasants\xe2\x80\x99\r\nnags which he had often seen straining their utmost under a heavy load\r\nof wood or hay, especially when the wheels were stuck in the mud or in\r\na rut. And the peasants would beat them so cruelly, sometimes even\r\nabout the nose and eyes, and he felt so sorry, so sorry for them that\r\nhe almost cried, and his mother always used to take him away from the\r\nwindow. All of a sudden there was a great uproar of shouting, singing\r\nand the balala\xc3\xafka, and from the tavern a number of big and very drunken\r\npeasants came out, wearing red and blue shirts and coats thrown over\r\ntheir shoulders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet in, get in!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted one of them, a young thick-necked peasant with\r\na fleshy face red as a carrot. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll take you all, get in!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut at once there was an outbreak of laughter and exclamations in the\r\ncrowd.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake us all with a beast like that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Mikolka, are you crazy to put a nag like that in such a cart?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd this mare is twenty if she is a day, mates!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet in, I\xe2\x80\x99ll take you all,\xe2\x80\x9d Mikolka shouted again, leaping first into\r\nthe cart, seizing the reins and standing straight up in front. \xe2\x80\x9cThe bay\r\nhas gone with Matvey,\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted from the cart--\xe2\x80\x9cand this brute, mates,\r\nis just breaking my heart, I feel as if I could kill her. She\xe2\x80\x99s just\r\neating her head off. Get in, I tell you! I\xe2\x80\x99ll make her gallop! She\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ngallop!\xe2\x80\x9d and he picked up the whip, preparing himself with relish to\r\nflog the little mare.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet in! Come along!\xe2\x80\x9d The crowd laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99you hear, she\xe2\x80\x99ll gallop!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGallop indeed! She has not had a gallop in her for the last ten years!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99ll jog along!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you mind her, mates, bring a whip each of you, get ready!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right! Give it to her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey all clambered into Mikolka\xe2\x80\x99s cart, laughing and making jokes. Six\r\nmen got in and there was still room for more. They hauled in a fat,\r\nrosy-cheeked woman. She was dressed in red cotton, in a pointed, beaded\r\nheaddress and thick leather shoes; she was cracking nuts and laughing.\r\nThe crowd round them was laughing too and indeed, how could they help\r\nlaughing? That wretched nag was to drag all the cartload of them at a\r\ngallop! Two young fellows in the cart were just getting whips ready to\r\nhelp Mikolka. With the cry of \xe2\x80\x9cnow,\xe2\x80\x9d the mare tugged with all her might,\r\nbut far from galloping, could scarcely move forward; she struggled with\r\nher legs, gasping and shrinking from the blows of the three whips which\r\nwere showered upon her like hail. The laughter in the cart and in the\r\ncrowd was redoubled, but Mikolka flew into a rage and furiously thrashed\r\nthe mare, as though he supposed she really could gallop.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me get in, too, mates,\xe2\x80\x9d shouted a young man in the crowd whose\r\nappetite was aroused.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet in, all get in,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mikolka, \xe2\x80\x9cshe will draw you all. I\xe2\x80\x99ll beat\r\nher to death!\xe2\x80\x9d And he thrashed and thrashed at the mare, beside himself\r\nwith fury.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFather, father,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, \xe2\x80\x9cfather, what are they doing? Father, they\r\nare beating the poor horse!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome along, come along!\xe2\x80\x9d said his father. \xe2\x80\x9cThey are drunken and\r\nfoolish, they are in fun; come away, don\xe2\x80\x99t look!\xe2\x80\x9d and he tried to draw\r\nhim away, but he tore himself away from his hand, and, beside himself\r\nwith horror, ran to the horse. The poor beast was in a bad way. She was\r\ngasping, standing still, then tugging again and almost falling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeat her to death,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mikolka, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s come to that. I\xe2\x80\x99ll do for\r\nher!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you about, are you a Christian, you devil?\xe2\x80\x9d shouted an old man\r\nin the crowd.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid anyone ever see the like? A wretched nag like that pulling such a\r\ncartload,\xe2\x80\x9d said another.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll kill her,\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the third.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t meddle! It\xe2\x80\x99s my property, I\xe2\x80\x99ll do what I choose. Get in, more of\r\nyou! Get in, all of you! I will have her go at a gallop!...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll at once laughter broke into a roar and covered everything: the mare,\r\nroused by the shower of blows, began feebly kicking. Even the old man\r\ncould not help smiling. To think of a wretched little beast like that\r\ntrying to kick!\r\n\r\nTwo lads in the crowd snatched up whips and ran to the mare to beat her\r\nabout the ribs. One ran each side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHit her in the face, in the eyes, in the eyes,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mikolka.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive us a song, mates,\xe2\x80\x9d shouted someone in the cart and everyone in the\r\ncart joined in a riotous song, jingling a tambourine and whistling. The\r\nwoman went on cracking nuts and laughing.\r\n\r\n... He ran beside the mare, ran in front of her, saw her being whipped\r\nacross the eyes, right in the eyes! He was crying, he felt choking, his\r\ntears were streaming. One of the men gave him a cut with the whip across\r\nthe face, he did not feel it. Wringing his hands and screaming, he\r\nrushed up to the grey-headed old man with the grey beard, who was\r\nshaking his head in disapproval. One woman seized him by the hand and\r\nwould have taken him away, but he tore himself from her and ran back to\r\nthe mare. She was almost at the last gasp, but began kicking once more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll teach you to kick,\xe2\x80\x9d Mikolka shouted ferociously. He threw down\r\nthe whip, bent forward and picked up from the bottom of the cart a long,\r\nthick shaft, he took hold of one end with both hands and with an effort\r\nbrandished it over the mare.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll crush her,\xe2\x80\x9d was shouted round him. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll kill her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s my property,\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Mikolka and brought the shaft down with a\r\nswinging blow. There was a sound of a heavy thud.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThrash her, thrash her! Why have you stopped?\xe2\x80\x9d shouted voices in the\r\ncrowd.\r\n\r\nAnd Mikolka swung the shaft a second time and it fell a second time\r\non the spine of the luckless mare. She sank back on her haunches, but\r\nlurched forward and tugged forward with all her force, tugged first on\r\none side and then on the other, trying to move the cart. But the six\r\nwhips were attacking her in all directions, and the shaft was raised\r\nagain and fell upon her a third time, then a fourth, with heavy measured\r\nblows. Mikolka was in a fury that he could not kill her at one blow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s a tough one,\xe2\x80\x9d was shouted in the crowd.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99ll fall in a minute, mates, there will soon be an end of her,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nan admiring spectator in the crowd.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFetch an axe to her! Finish her off,\xe2\x80\x9d shouted a third.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll show you! Stand off,\xe2\x80\x9d Mikolka screamed frantically; he threw down\r\nthe shaft, stooped down in the cart and picked up an iron crowbar. \xe2\x80\x9cLook\r\nout,\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted, and with all his might he dealt a stunning blow at the\r\npoor mare. The blow fell; the mare staggered, sank back, tried to pull,\r\nbut the bar fell again with a swinging blow on her back and she fell on\r\nthe ground like a log.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFinish her off,\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Mikolka and he leapt beside himself, out of\r\nthe cart. Several young men, also flushed with drink, seized anything\r\nthey could come across--whips, sticks, poles, and ran to the dying\r\nmare. Mikolka stood on one side and began dealing random blows with the\r\ncrowbar. The mare stretched out her head, drew a long breath and died.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou butchered her,\xe2\x80\x9d someone shouted in the crowd.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t she gallop then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy property!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Mikolka, with bloodshot eyes, brandishing the bar\r\nin his hands. He stood as though regretting that he had nothing more to\r\nbeat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo mistake about it, you are not a Christian,\xe2\x80\x9d many voices were\r\nshouting in the crowd.\r\n\r\nBut the poor boy, beside himself, made his way, screaming, through the\r\ncrowd to the sorrel nag, put his arms round her bleeding dead head and\r\nkissed it, kissed the eyes and kissed the lips.... Then he jumped up and\r\nflew in a frenzy with his little fists out at Mikolka. At that instant\r\nhis father, who had been running after him, snatched him up and carried\r\nhim out of the crowd.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome along, come! Let us go home,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFather! Why did they... kill... the poor horse!\xe2\x80\x9d he sobbed, but his\r\nvoice broke and the words came in shrieks from his panting chest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are drunk.... They are brutal... it\xe2\x80\x99s not our business!\xe2\x80\x9d said his\r\nfather. He put his arms round his father but he felt choked, choked. He\r\ntried to draw a breath, to cry out--and woke up.\r\n\r\nHe waked up, gasping for breath, his hair soaked with perspiration, and\r\nstood up in terror.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank God, that was only a dream,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, sitting down under a tree\r\nand drawing deep breaths. \xe2\x80\x9cBut what is it? Is it some fever coming on?\r\nSuch a hideous dream!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe felt utterly broken: darkness and confusion were in his soul. He\r\nrested his elbows on his knees and leaned his head on his hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood God!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, \xe2\x80\x9ccan it be, can it be, that I shall really take an\r\naxe, that I shall strike her on the head, split her skull open... that I\r\nshall tread in the sticky warm blood, break the lock, steal and tremble;\r\nhide, all spattered in the blood... with the axe.... Good God, can it\r\nbe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was shaking like a leaf as he said this.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why am I going on like this?\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, sitting up again, as it\r\nwere in profound amazement. \xe2\x80\x9cI knew that I could never bring myself\r\nto it, so what have I been torturing myself for till now? Yesterday,\r\nyesterday, when I went to make that... _experiment_, yesterday I\r\nrealised completely that I could never bear to do it.... Why am I going\r\nover it again, then? Why am I hesitating? As I came down the stairs\r\nyesterday, I said myself that it was base, loathsome, vile, vile... the\r\nvery thought of it made me feel sick and filled me with horror.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do it, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do it! Granted, granted that there is\r\nno flaw in all that reasoning, that all that I have concluded this last\r\nmonth is clear as day, true as arithmetic.... My God! Anyway I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbring myself to it! I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do it, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do it! Why, why then am\r\nI still...?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe rose to his feet, looked round in wonder as though surprised at\r\nfinding himself in this place, and went towards the bridge. He was pale,\r\nhis eyes glowed, he was exhausted in every limb, but he seemed suddenly\r\nto breathe more easily. He felt he had cast off that fearful burden that\r\nhad so long been weighing upon him, and all at once there was a sense\r\nof relief and peace in his soul. \xe2\x80\x9cLord,\xe2\x80\x9d he prayed, \xe2\x80\x9cshow me my path--I\r\nrenounce that accursed... dream of mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCrossing the bridge, he gazed quietly and calmly at the Neva, at the\r\nglowing red sun setting in the glowing sky. In spite of his weakness he\r\nwas not conscious of fatigue. It was as though an abscess that had been\r\nforming for a month past in his heart had suddenly broken. Freedom,\r\nfreedom! He was free from that spell, that sorcery, that obsession!\r\n\r\nLater on, when he recalled that time and all that happened to him during\r\nthose days, minute by minute, point by point, he was superstitiously\r\nimpressed by one circumstance, which, though in itself not very\r\nexceptional, always seemed to him afterwards the predestined\r\nturning-point of his fate. He could never understand and explain to\r\nhimself why, when he was tired and worn out, when it would have been\r\nmore convenient for him to go home by the shortest and most direct way,\r\nhe had returned by the Hay Market where he had no need to go. It was\r\nobviously and quite unnecessarily out of his way, though not much so. It\r\nis true that it happened to him dozens of times to return home without\r\nnoticing what streets he passed through. But why, he was always asking\r\nhimself, why had such an important, such a decisive and at the same time\r\nsuch an absolutely chance meeting happened in the Hay Market (where he\r\nhad moreover no reason to go) at the very hour, the very minute of his\r\nlife when he was just in the very mood and in the very circumstances\r\nin which that meeting was able to exert the gravest and most decisive\r\ninfluence on his whole destiny? As though it had been lying in wait for\r\nhim on purpose!\r\n\r\nIt was about nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock when he crossed the Hay Market. At the tables\r\nand the barrows, at the booths and the shops, all the market people were\r\nclosing their establishments or clearing away and packing up their\r\nwares and, like their customers, were going home. Rag pickers and\r\ncostermongers of all kinds were crowding round the taverns in the dirty\r\nand stinking courtyards of the Hay Market. Raskolnikov particularly\r\nliked this place and the neighbouring alleys, when he wandered aimlessly\r\nin the streets. Here his rags did not attract contemptuous attention,\r\nand one could walk about in any attire without scandalising people. At\r\nthe corner of an alley a huckster and his wife had two tables set out\r\nwith tapes, thread, cotton handkerchiefs, etc. They, too, had got up to\r\ngo home, but were lingering in conversation with a friend, who had just\r\ncome up to them. This friend was Lizaveta Ivanovna, or, as everyone\r\ncalled her, Lizaveta, the younger sister of the old pawnbroker, Alyona\r\nIvanovna, whom Raskolnikov had visited the previous day to pawn his\r\nwatch and make his _experiment_.... He already knew all about Lizaveta\r\nand she knew him a little too. She was a single woman of about\r\nthirty-five, tall, clumsy, timid, submissive and almost idiotic. She was\r\na complete slave and went in fear and trembling of her sister, who\r\nmade her work day and night, and even beat her. She was standing with\r\na bundle before the huckster and his wife, listening earnestly and\r\ndoubtfully. They were talking of something with special warmth. The\r\nmoment Raskolnikov caught sight of her, he was overcome by a strange\r\nsensation as it were of intense astonishment, though there was nothing\r\nastonishing about this meeting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou could make up your mind for yourself, Lizaveta Ivanovna,\xe2\x80\x9d the\r\nhuckster was saying aloud. \xe2\x80\x9cCome round to-morrow about seven. They will\r\nbe here too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow?\xe2\x80\x9d said Lizaveta slowly and thoughtfully, as though unable to\r\nmake up her mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpon my word, what a fright you are in of Alyona Ivanovna,\xe2\x80\x9d gabbled\r\nthe huckster\xe2\x80\x99s wife, a lively little woman. \xe2\x80\x9cI look at you, you are like\r\nsome little babe. And she is not your own sister either--nothing but a\r\nstep-sister and what a hand she keeps over you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut this time don\xe2\x80\x99t say a word to Alyona Ivanovna,\xe2\x80\x9d her husband\r\ninterrupted; \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s my advice, but come round to us without asking.\r\nIt will be worth your while. Later on your sister herself may have a\r\nnotion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I to come?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock to-morrow. And they will be here. You will be able\r\nto decide for yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a cup of tea,\xe2\x80\x9d added his wife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, I\xe2\x80\x99ll come,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lizaveta, still pondering, and she began\r\nslowly moving away.\r\n\r\nRaskolnikov had just passed and heard no more. He passed softly,\r\nunnoticed, trying not to miss a word. His first amazement was followed\r\nby a thrill of horror, like a shiver running down his spine. He had\r\nlearnt, he had suddenly quite unexpectedly learnt, that the next day at\r\nseven o\xe2\x80\x99clock Lizaveta, the old woman\xe2\x80\x99s sister and only companion, would\r\nbe away from home and that therefore at seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock precisely the old\r\nwoman _would be left alone_.\r\n\r\nHe was only a few steps from his lodging. He went in like a man\r\ncondemned to death. He thought of nothing and was incapable of thinking;\r\nbut he felt suddenly in his whole being that he had no more freedom\r\nof thought, no will, and that everything was suddenly and irrevocably\r\ndecided.\r\n\r\nCertainly, if he had to wait whole years for a suitable opportunity, he\r\ncould not reckon on a more certain step towards the success of the plan\r\nthan that which had just presented itself. In any case, it would have\r\nbeen difficult to find out beforehand and with certainty, with\r\ngreater exactness and less risk, and without dangerous inquiries and\r\ninvestigations, that next day at a certain time an old woman, on whose\r\nlife an attempt was contemplated, would be at home and entirely alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nLater on Raskolnikov happened to find out why the huckster and his\r\nwife had invited Lizaveta. It was a very ordinary matter and there was\r\nnothing exceptional about it. A family who had come to the town and been\r\nreduced to poverty were selling their household goods and clothes, all\r\nwomen\xe2\x80\x99s things. As the things would have fetched little in the market,\r\nthey were looking for a dealer. This was Lizaveta\xe2\x80\x99s business. She\r\nundertook such jobs and was frequently employed, as she was very honest\r\nand always fixed a fair price and stuck to it. She spoke as a rule\r\nlittle and, as we have said already, she was very submissive and timid.\r\n\r\nBut Raskolnikov had become superstitious of late. The traces of\r\nsuperstition remained in him long after, and were almost ineradicable.\r\nAnd in all this he was always afterwards disposed to see something\r\nstrange and mysterious, as it were, the presence of some peculiar\r\ninfluences and coincidences. In the previous winter a student he knew\r\ncalled Pokorev, who had left for Harkov, had chanced in conversation to\r\ngive him the address of Alyona Ivanovna, the old pawnbroker, in case he\r\nmight want to pawn anything. For a long while he did not go to her, for\r\nhe had lessons and managed to get along somehow. Six weeks ago he had\r\nremembered the address; he had two articles that could be pawned: his\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s old silver watch and a little gold ring with three red stones,\r\na present from his sister at parting. He decided to take the ring. When\r\nhe found the old woman he had felt an insurmountable repulsion for her\r\nat the first glance, though he knew nothing special about her. He got\r\ntwo roubles from her and went into a miserable little tavern on his way\r\nhome. He asked for tea, sat down and sank into deep thought. A strange\r\nidea was pecking at his brain like a chicken in the egg, and very, very\r\nmuch absorbed him.\r\n\r\nAlmost beside him at the next table there was sitting a student, whom he\r\ndid not know and had never seen, and with him a young officer. They had\r\nplayed a game of billiards and began drinking tea. All at once he heard\r\nthe student mention to the officer the pawnbroker Alyona Ivanovna and\r\ngive him her address. This of itself seemed strange to Raskolnikov; he\r\nhad just come from her and here at once he heard her name. Of course\r\nit was a chance, but he could not shake off a very extraordinary\r\nimpression, and here someone seemed to be speaking expressly for him;\r\nthe student began telling his friend various details about Alyona\r\nIvanovna.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is first-rate,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can always get money from her. She is\r\nas rich as a Jew, she can give you five thousand roubles at a time and\r\nshe is not above taking a pledge for a rouble. Lots of our fellows have\r\nhad dealings with her. But she is an awful old harpy....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he began describing how spiteful and uncertain she was, how if you\r\nwere only a day late with your interest the pledge was lost; how she\r\ngave a quarter of the value of an article and took five and even seven\r\npercent a month on it and so on. The student chattered on, saying\r\nthat she had a sister Lizaveta, whom the wretched little creature was\r\ncontinually beating, and kept in complete bondage like a small child,\r\nthough Lizaveta was at least six feet high.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a phenomenon for you,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the student and he laughed.\r\n\r\nThey began talking about Lizaveta. The student spoke about her with a\r\npeculiar relish and was continually laughing and the officer listened\r\nwith great interest and asked him to send Lizaveta to do some mending\r\nfor him. Raskolnikov did not miss a word and learned everything about\r\nher. Lizaveta was younger than the old woman and was her half-sister,\r\nbeing the child of a different mother. She was thirty-five. She worked\r\nday and night for her sister, and besides doing the cooking and the\r\nwashing, she did sewing and worked as a charwoman and gave her sister\r\nall she earned. She did not dare to accept an order or job of any kind\r\nwithout her sister\xe2\x80\x99s permission. The old woman had already made her\r\nwill, and Lizaveta knew of it, and by this will she would not get a\r\nfarthing; nothing but the movables, chairs and so on; all the money was\r\nleft to a monastery in the province of N----, that prayers might be\r\nsaid for her in perpetuity. Lizaveta was of lower rank than her sister,\r\nunmarried and awfully uncouth in appearance, remarkably tall with long\r\nfeet that looked as if they were bent outwards. She always wore battered\r\ngoatskin shoes, and was clean in her person. What the student expressed\r\nmost surprise and amusement about was the fact that Lizaveta was\r\ncontinually with child.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you say she is hideous?\xe2\x80\x9d observed the officer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, she is so dark-skinned and looks like a soldier dressed up, but\r\nyou know she is not at all hideous. She has such a good-natured face\r\nand eyes. Strikingly so. And the proof of it is that lots of people are\r\nattracted by her. She is such a soft, gentle creature, ready to put up\r\nwith anything, always willing, willing to do anything. And her smile is\r\nreally very sweet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou seem to find her attractive yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d laughed the officer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom her queerness. No, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what. I could kill that damned\r\nold woman and make off with her money, I assure you, without the\r\nfaintest conscience-prick,\xe2\x80\x9d the student added with warmth. The officer\r\nlaughed again while Raskolnikov shuddered. How strange it was!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen, I want to ask you a serious question,\xe2\x80\x9d the student said hotly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was joking of course, but look here; on one side we have a stupid,\r\nsenseless, worthless, spiteful, ailing, horrid old woman, not simply\r\nuseless but doing actual mischief, who has not an idea what she is\r\nliving for herself, and who will die in a day or two in any case. You\r\nunderstand? You understand?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, I understand,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the officer, watching his excited\r\ncompanion attentively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, listen then. On the other side, fresh young lives thrown away for\r\nwant of help and by thousands, on every side! A hundred thousand good\r\ndeeds could be done and helped, on that old woman\xe2\x80\x99s money which will be\r\nburied in a monastery! Hundreds, thousands perhaps, might be set on the\r\nright path; dozens of families saved from destitution, from ruin, from\r\nvice, from the Lock hospitals--and all with her money. Kill her, take\r\nher money and with the help of it devote oneself to the service of\r\nhumanity and the good of all. What do you think, would not one tiny\r\ncrime be wiped out by thousands of good deeds? For one life thousands\r\nwould be saved from corruption and decay. One death, and a hundred lives\r\nin exchange--it\xe2\x80\x99s simple arithmetic! Besides, what value has the life of\r\nthat sickly, stupid, ill-natured old woman in the balance of existence!\r\nNo more than the life of a louse, of a black-beetle, less in fact\r\nbecause the old woman is doing harm. She is wearing out the lives of\r\nothers; the other day she bit Lizaveta\xe2\x80\x99s finger out of spite; it almost\r\nhad to be amputated.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course she does not deserve to live,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked the officer, \xe2\x80\x9cbut\r\nthere it is, it\xe2\x80\x99s nature.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, well, brother, but we have to correct and direct nature, and, but\r\nfor that, we should drown in an ocean of prejudice. But for that,\r\nthere would never have been a single great man. They talk of\r\nduty, conscience--I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to say anything against duty and\r\nconscience;--but the point is, what do we mean by them? Stay, I have\r\nanother question to ask you. Listen!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, you stay, I\xe2\x80\x99ll ask you a question. Listen!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are talking and speechifying away, but tell me, would you kill the\r\nold woman _yourself_?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course not! I was only arguing the justice of it.... It\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to\r\ndo with me....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I think, if you would not do it yourself, there\xe2\x80\x99s no justice about\r\nit.... Let us have another game.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRaskolnikov was violently agitated. Of course, it was all ordinary\r\nyouthful talk and thought, such as he had often heard before in\r\ndifferent forms and on different themes. But why had he happened to hear\r\nsuch a discussion and such ideas at the very moment when his own brain\r\nwas just conceiving... _the very same ideas_? And why, just at the\r\nmoment when he had brought away the embryo of his idea from the old\r\nwoman had he dropped at once upon a conversation about her? This\r\ncoincidence always seemed strange to him. This trivial talk in a tavern\r\nhad an immense influence on him in his later action; as though there had\r\nreally been in it something preordained, some guiding hint....\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nOn returning from the Hay Market he flung himself on the sofa and sat\r\nfor a whole hour without stirring. Meanwhile it got dark; he had no\r\ncandle and, indeed, it did not occur to him to light up. He could never\r\nrecollect whether he had been thinking about anything at that time. At\r\nlast he was conscious of his former fever and shivering, and he realised\r\nwith relief that he could lie down on the sofa. Soon heavy, leaden sleep\r\ncame over him, as it were crushing him.\r\n\r\nHe slept an extraordinarily long time and without dreaming. Nastasya,\r\ncoming into his room at ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock the next morning, had difficulty\r\nin rousing him. She brought him in tea and bread. The tea was again the\r\nsecond brew and again in her own tea-pot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy goodness, how he sleeps!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried indignantly. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd he is always\r\nasleep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe got up with an effort. His head ached, he stood up, took a turn in\r\nhis garret and sank back on the sofa again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoing to sleep again,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Nastasya. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you ill, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe made no reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you want some tea?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfterwards,\xe2\x80\x9d he said with an effort, closing his eyes again and turning\r\nto the wall.\r\n\r\nNastasya stood over him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps he really is ill,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, turned and went out. She came in\r\nagain at two o\xe2\x80\x99clock with soup. He was lying as before. The tea stood\r\nuntouched. Nastasya felt positively offended and began wrathfully\r\nrousing him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy are you lying like a log?\xe2\x80\x9d she shouted, looking at him with\r\nrepulsion.\r\n\r\nHe got up, and sat down again, but said nothing and stared at the floor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you ill or not?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Nastasya and again received no answer.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d better go out and get a breath of air,\xe2\x80\x9d she said after a pause.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you eat it or not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfterwards,\xe2\x80\x9d he said weakly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he motioned her out.\r\n\r\nShe remained a little longer, looked at him with compassion and went\r\nout.\r\n\r\nA few minutes afterwards, he raised his eyes and looked for a long while\r\nat the tea and the soup. Then he took the bread, took up a spoon and\r\nbegan to eat.\r\n\r\nHe ate a little, three or four spoonfuls, without appetite, as it were\r\nmechanically. His head ached less. After his meal he stretched himself\r\non the sofa again, but now he could not sleep; he lay without stirring,\r\nwith his face in the pillow. He was haunted by day-dreams and such\r\nstrange day-dreams; in one, that kept recurring, he fancied that he was\r\nin Africa, in Egypt, in some sort of oasis. The caravan was resting,\r\nthe camels were peacefully lying down; the palms stood all around in a\r\ncomplete circle; all the party were at dinner. But he was drinking water\r\nfrom a spring which flowed gurgling close by. And it was so cool, it was\r\nwonderful, wonderful, blue, cold water running among the parti-coloured\r\nstones and over the clean sand which glistened here and there like\r\ngold.... Suddenly he heard a clock strike. He started, roused himself,\r\nraised his head, looked out of the window, and seeing how late it was,\r\nsuddenly jumped up wide awake as though someone had pulled him off the\r\nsofa. He crept on tiptoe to the door, stealthily opened it and began\r\nlistening on the staircase. His heart beat terribly. But all was quiet\r\non the stairs as if everyone was asleep.... It seemed to him strange and\r\nmonstrous that he could have slept in such forgetfulness from the\r\nprevious day and had done nothing, had prepared nothing yet.... And\r\nmeanwhile perhaps it had struck six. And his drowsiness and stupefaction\r\nwere followed by an extraordinary, feverish, as it were distracted\r\nhaste. But the preparations to be made were few. He concentrated all his\r\nenergies on thinking of everything and forgetting nothing; and his heart\r\nkept beating and thumping so that he could hardly breathe. First he had\r\nto make a noose and sew it into his overcoat--a work of a moment. He\r\nrummaged under his pillow and picked out amongst the linen stuffed away\r\nunder it, a worn out, old unwashed shirt. From its rags he tore a long\r\nstrip, a couple of inches wide and about sixteen inches long. He folded\r\nthis strip in two, took off his wide, strong summer overcoat of some\r\nstout cotton material (his only outer garment) and began sewing the two\r\nends of the rag on the inside, under the left armhole. His hands shook\r\nas he sewed, but he did it successfully so that nothing showed outside\r\nwhen he put the coat on again. The needle and thread he had got ready\r\nlong before and they lay on his table in a piece of paper. As for the\r\nnoose, it was a very ingenious device of his own; the noose was intended\r\nfor the axe. It was impossible for him to carry the axe through the\r\nstreet in his hands. And if hidden under his coat he would still have\r\nhad to support it with his hand, which would have been noticeable. Now\r\nhe had only to put the head of the axe in the noose, and it would hang\r\nquietly under his arm on the inside. Putting his hand in his coat\r\npocket, he could hold the end of the handle all the way, so that it did\r\nnot swing; and as the coat was very full, a regular sack in fact, it\r\ncould not be seen from outside that he was holding something with the\r\nhand that was in the pocket. This noose, too, he had designed a\r\nfortnight before.\r\n\r\nWhen he had finished with this, he thrust his hand into a little opening\r\nbetween his sofa and the floor, fumbled in the left corner and drew out\r\nthe _pledge_, which he had got ready long before and hidden there. This\r\npledge was, however, only a smoothly planed piece of wood the size and\r\nthickness of a silver cigarette case. He picked up this piece of wood\r\nin one of his wanderings in a courtyard where there was some sort of\r\na workshop. Afterwards he had added to the wood a thin smooth piece\r\nof iron, which he had also picked up at the same time in the street.\r\nPutting the iron which was a little the smaller on the piece of wood,\r\nhe fastened them very firmly, crossing and re-crossing the thread round\r\nthem; then wrapped them carefully and daintily in clean white paper and\r\ntied up the parcel so that it would be very difficult to untie it. This\r\nwas in order to divert the attention of the old woman for a time, while\r\nshe was trying to undo the knot, and so to gain a moment. The iron strip\r\nwas added to give weight, so that the woman might not guess the first\r\nminute that the \xe2\x80\x9cthing\xe2\x80\x9d was made of wood. All this had been stored by\r\nhim beforehand under the sofa. He had only just got the pledge out when\r\nhe heard someone suddenly about in the yard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt struck six long ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLong ago! My God!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe rushed to the door, listened, caught up his hat and began to descend\r\nhis thirteen steps cautiously, noiselessly, like a cat. He had still the\r\nmost important thing to do--to steal the axe from the kitchen. That the\r\ndeed must be done with an axe he had decided long ago. He had also a\r\npocket pruning-knife, but he could not rely on the knife and still less\r\non his own strength, and so resolved finally on the axe. We may note in\r\npassing, one peculiarity in regard to all the final resolutions taken by\r\nhim in the matter; they had one strange characteristic: the more final\r\nthey were, the more hideous and the more absurd they at once became in\r\nhis eyes. In spite of all his agonising inward struggle, he never for\r\na single instant all that time could believe in the carrying out of his\r\nplans.\r\n\r\nAnd, indeed, if it had ever happened that everything to the least point\r\ncould have been considered and finally settled, and no uncertainty of\r\nany kind had remained, he would, it seems, have renounced it all\r\nas something absurd, monstrous and impossible. But a whole mass of\r\nunsettled points and uncertainties remained. As for getting the axe,\r\nthat trifling business cost him no anxiety, for nothing could be easier.\r\nNastasya was continually out of the house, especially in the evenings;\r\nshe would run in to the neighbours or to a shop, and always left the\r\ndoor ajar. It was the one thing the landlady was always scolding her\r\nabout. And so, when the time came, he would only have to go quietly into\r\nthe kitchen and to take the axe, and an hour later (when everything\r\nwas over) go in and put it back again. But these were doubtful points.\r\nSupposing he returned an hour later to put it back, and Nastasya had\r\ncome back and was on the spot. He would of course have to go by and wait\r\ntill she went out again. But supposing she were in the meantime to miss\r\nthe axe, look for it, make an outcry--that would mean suspicion or at\r\nleast grounds for suspicion.\r\n\r\nBut those were all trifles which he had not even begun to consider, and\r\nindeed he had no time. He was thinking of the chief point, and put off\r\ntrifling details, until _he could believe in it all_. But that seemed\r\nutterly unattainable. So it seemed to himself at least. He could not\r\nimagine, for instance, that he would sometime leave off thinking, get\r\nup and simply go there.... Even his late experiment (i.e. his visit with\r\nthe object of a final survey of the place) was simply an attempt at\r\nan experiment, far from being the real thing, as though one should say\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ccome, let us go and try it--why dream about it!\xe2\x80\x9d--and at once he\r\nhad broken down and had run away cursing, in a frenzy with himself.\r\nMeanwhile it would seem, as regards the moral question, that his\r\nanalysis was complete; his casuistry had become keen as a razor, and he\r\ncould not find rational objections in himself. But in the last resort\r\nhe simply ceased to believe in himself, and doggedly, slavishly sought\r\narguments in all directions, fumbling for them, as though someone were\r\nforcing and drawing him to it.\r\n\r\nAt first--long before indeed--he had been much occupied with one\r\nquestion; why almost all crimes are so badly concealed and so easily\r\ndetected, and why almost all criminals leave such obvious traces? He\r\nhad come gradually to many different and curious conclusions, and in his\r\nopinion the chief reason lay not so much in the material impossibility\r\nof concealing the crime, as in the criminal himself. Almost every\r\ncriminal is subject to a failure of will and reasoning power by a\r\nchildish and phenomenal heedlessness, at the very instant when prudence\r\nand caution are most essential. It was his conviction that this eclipse\r\nof reason and failure of will power attacked a man like a disease,\r\ndeveloped gradually and reached its highest point just before the\r\nperpetration of the crime, continued with equal violence at the moment\r\nof the crime and for longer or shorter time after, according to the\r\nindividual case, and then passed off like any other disease. The\r\nquestion whether the disease gives rise to the crime, or whether the\r\ncrime from its own peculiar nature is always accompanied by something of\r\nthe nature of disease, he did not yet feel able to decide.\r\n\r\nWhen he reached these conclusions, he decided that in his own case there\r\ncould not be such a morbid reaction, that his reason and will would\r\nremain unimpaired at the time of carrying out his design, for the\r\nsimple reason that his design was \xe2\x80\x9cnot a crime....\xe2\x80\x9d We will omit all the\r\nprocess by means of which he arrived at this last conclusion; we have\r\nrun too far ahead already.... We may add only that the practical, purely\r\nmaterial difficulties of the affair occupied a secondary position in his\r\nmind. \xe2\x80\x9cOne has but to keep all one\xe2\x80\x99s will-power and reason to deal\r\nwith them, and they will all be overcome at the time when once one has\r\nfamiliarised oneself with the minutest details of the business....\xe2\x80\x9d But\r\nthis preparation had never been begun. His final decisions were what he\r\ncame to trust least, and when the hour struck, it all came to pass quite\r\ndifferently, as it were accidentally and unexpectedly.\r\n\r\nOne trifling circumstance upset his calculations, before he had even\r\nleft the staircase. When he reached the landlady\xe2\x80\x99s kitchen, the door\r\nof which was open as usual, he glanced cautiously in to see whether, in\r\nNastasya\xe2\x80\x99s absence, the landlady herself was there, or if not, whether\r\nthe door to her own room was closed, so that she might not peep out when\r\nhe went in for the axe. But what was his amazement when he suddenly\r\nsaw that Nastasya was not only at home in the kitchen, but was occupied\r\nthere, taking linen out of a basket and hanging it on a line. Seeing\r\nhim, she left off hanging the clothes, turned to him and stared at him\r\nall the time he was passing. He turned away his eyes, and walked past as\r\nthough he noticed nothing. But it was the end of everything; he had not\r\nthe axe! He was overwhelmed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat made me think,\xe2\x80\x9d he reflected, as he went under the gateway, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat\r\nmade me think that she would be sure not to be at home at that moment!\r\nWhy, why, why did I assume this so certainly?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was crushed and even humiliated. He could have laughed at himself in\r\nhis anger.... A dull animal rage boiled within him.\r\n\r\nHe stood hesitating in the gateway. To go into the street, to go a walk\r\nfor appearance\xe2\x80\x99 sake was revolting; to go back to his room, even more\r\nrevolting. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what a chance I have lost for ever!\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered,\r\nstanding aimlessly in the gateway, just opposite the porter\xe2\x80\x99s little\r\ndark room, which was also open. Suddenly he started. From the porter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nroom, two paces away from him, something shining under the bench to the\r\nright caught his eye.... He looked about him--nobody. He approached the\r\nroom on tiptoe, went down two steps into it and in a faint voice called\r\nthe porter. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, not at home! Somewhere near though, in the yard, for\r\nthe door is wide open.\xe2\x80\x9d He dashed to the axe (it was an axe) and pulled\r\nit out from under the bench, where it lay between two chunks of wood;\r\nat once, before going out, he made it fast in the noose, he thrust both\r\nhands into his pockets and went out of the room; no one had noticed him!\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen reason fails, the devil helps!\xe2\x80\x9d he thought with a strange grin.\r\nThis chance raised his spirits extraordinarily.\r\n\r\nHe walked along quietly and sedately, without hurry, to avoid awakening\r\nsuspicion. He scarcely looked at the passers-by, tried to escape looking\r\nat their faces at all, and to be as little noticeable as possible.\r\nSuddenly he thought of his hat. \xe2\x80\x9cGood heavens! I had the money the day\r\nbefore yesterday and did not get a cap to wear instead!\xe2\x80\x9d A curse rose\r\nfrom the bottom of his soul.\r\n\r\nGlancing out of the corner of his eye into a shop, he saw by a clock on\r\nthe wall that it was ten minutes past seven. He had to make haste and at\r\nthe same time to go someway round, so as to approach the house from the\r\nother side....\r\n\r\nWhen he had happened to imagine all this beforehand, he had sometimes\r\nthought that he would be very much afraid. But he was not very much\r\nafraid now, was not afraid at all, indeed. His mind was even occupied\r\nby irrelevant matters, but by nothing for long. As he passed the Yusupov\r\ngarden, he was deeply absorbed in considering the building of great\r\nfountains, and of their refreshing effect on the atmosphere in all\r\nthe squares. By degrees he passed to the conviction that if the summer\r\ngarden were extended to the field of Mars, and perhaps joined to the\r\ngarden of the Mihailovsky Palace, it would be a splendid thing and a\r\ngreat benefit to the town. Then he was interested by the question why\r\nin all great towns men are not simply driven by necessity, but in some\r\npeculiar way inclined to live in those parts of the town where there\r\nare no gardens nor fountains; where there is most dirt and smell and all\r\nsorts of nastiness. Then his own walks through the Hay Market came back\r\nto his mind, and for a moment he waked up to reality. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat nonsense!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he thought, \xe2\x80\x9cbetter think of nothing at all!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo probably men led to execution clutch mentally at every object that\r\nmeets them on the way,\xe2\x80\x9d flashed through his mind, but simply flashed,\r\nlike lightning; he made haste to dismiss this thought.... And by now\r\nhe was near; here was the house, here was the gate. Suddenly a clock\r\nsomewhere struck once. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat! can it be half-past seven? Impossible, it\r\nmust be fast!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLuckily for him, everything went well again at the gates. At that very\r\nmoment, as though expressly for his benefit, a huge waggon of hay had\r\njust driven in at the gate, completely screening him as he passed under\r\nthe gateway, and the waggon had scarcely had time to drive through into\r\nthe yard, before he had slipped in a flash to the right. On the other\r\nside of the waggon he could hear shouting and quarrelling; but no one\r\nnoticed him and no one met him. Many windows looking into that huge\r\nquadrangular yard were open at that moment, but he did not raise his\r\nhead--he had not the strength to. The staircase leading to the old\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s room was close by, just on the right of the gateway. He was\r\nalready on the stairs....\r\n\r\nDrawing a breath, pressing his hand against his throbbing heart, and\r\nonce more feeling for the axe and setting it straight, he began softly\r\nand cautiously ascending the stairs, listening every minute. But the\r\nstairs, too, were quite deserted; all the doors were shut; he met no\r\none. One flat indeed on the first floor was wide open and painters were\r\nat work in it, but they did not glance at him. He stood still, thought\r\na minute and went on. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course it would be better if they had not been\r\nhere, but... it\xe2\x80\x99s two storeys above them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd there was the fourth storey, here was the door, here was the\r\nflat opposite, the empty one. The flat underneath the old woman\xe2\x80\x99s was\r\napparently empty also; the visiting card nailed on the door had been\r\ntorn off--they had gone away!... He was out of breath. For one instant\r\nthe thought floated through his mind \xe2\x80\x9cShall I go back?\xe2\x80\x9d But he made no\r\nanswer and began listening at the old woman\xe2\x80\x99s door, a dead silence. Then\r\nhe listened again on the staircase, listened long and intently...\r\nthen looked about him for the last time, pulled himself together, drew\r\nhimself up, and once more tried the axe in the noose. \xe2\x80\x9cAm I very pale?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he wondered. \xe2\x80\x9cAm I not evidently agitated? She is mistrustful.... Had I\r\nbetter wait a little longer... till my heart leaves off thumping?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut his heart did not leave off. On the contrary, as though to spite\r\nhim, it throbbed more and more violently. He could stand it no longer,\r\nhe slowly put out his hand to the bell and rang. Half a minute later he\r\nrang again, more loudly.\r\n\r\nNo answer. To go on ringing was useless and out of place. The old woman\r\nwas, of course, at home, but she was suspicious and alone. He had some\r\nknowledge of her habits... and once more he put his ear to the door.\r\nEither his senses were peculiarly keen (which it is difficult to\r\nsuppose), or the sound was really very distinct. Anyway, he suddenly\r\nheard something like the cautious touch of a hand on the lock and the\r\nrustle of a skirt at the very door. Someone was standing stealthily\r\nclose to the lock and just as he was doing on the outside was secretly\r\nlistening within, and seemed to have her ear to the door.... He moved\r\na little on purpose and muttered something aloud that he might not have\r\nthe appearance of hiding, then rang a third time, but quietly, soberly,\r\nand without impatience, Recalling it afterwards, that moment stood out\r\nin his mind vividly, distinctly, for ever; he could not make out how he\r\nhad had such cunning, for his mind was as it were clouded at moments and\r\nhe was almost unconscious of his body.... An instant later he heard the\r\nlatch unfastened.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nThe door was as before opened a tiny crack, and again two sharp and\r\nsuspicious eyes stared at him out of the darkness. Then Raskolnikov lost\r\nhis head and nearly made a great mistake.\r\n\r\nFearing the old woman would be frightened by their being alone, and not\r\nhoping that the sight of him would disarm her suspicions, he took\r\nhold of the door and drew it towards him to prevent the old woman from\r\nattempting to shut it again. Seeing this she did not pull the door back,\r\nbut she did not let go the handle so that he almost dragged her out with\r\nit on to the stairs. Seeing that she was standing in the doorway not\r\nallowing him to pass, he advanced straight upon her. She stepped back\r\nin alarm, tried to say something, but seemed unable to speak and stared\r\nwith open eyes at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood evening, Alyona Ivanovna,\xe2\x80\x9d he began, trying to speak easily, but\r\nhis voice would not obey him, it broke and shook. \xe2\x80\x9cI have come... I have\r\nbrought something... but we\xe2\x80\x99d better come in... to the light....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd leaving her, he passed straight into the room uninvited. The old\r\nwoman ran after him; her tongue was unloosed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood heavens! What it is? Who is it? What do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Alyona Ivanovna, you know me... Raskolnikov... here, I brought you\r\nthe pledge I promised the other day...\xe2\x80\x9d And he held out the pledge.\r\n\r\nThe old woman glanced for a moment at the pledge, but at once stared in\r\nthe eyes of her uninvited visitor. She looked intently, maliciously and\r\nmistrustfully. A minute passed; he even fancied something like a sneer\r\nin her eyes, as though she had already guessed everything. He felt that\r\nhe was losing his head, that he was almost frightened, so frightened\r\nthat if she were to look like that and not say a word for another half\r\nminute, he thought he would have run away from her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you look at me as though you did not know me?\xe2\x80\x9d he said suddenly,\r\nalso with malice. \xe2\x80\x9cTake it if you like, if not I\xe2\x80\x99ll go elsewhere, I am\r\nin a hurry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had not even thought of saying this, but it was suddenly said of\r\nitself. The old woman recovered herself, and her visitor\xe2\x80\x99s resolute tone\r\nevidently restored her confidence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why, my good sir, all of a minute.... What is it?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked,\r\nlooking at the pledge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe silver cigarette case; I spoke of it last time, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe held out her hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how pale you are, to be sure... and your hands are trembling too?\r\nHave you been bathing, or what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFever,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered abruptly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t help getting pale... if you\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nnothing to eat,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, with difficulty articulating the words.\r\n\r\nHis strength was failing him again. But his answer sounded like the\r\ntruth; the old woman took the pledge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked once more, scanning Raskolnikov intently, and\r\nweighing the pledge in her hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA thing... cigarette case.... Silver.... Look at it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt does not seem somehow like silver.... How he has wrapped it up!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTrying to untie the string and turning to the window, to the light (all\r\nher windows were shut, in spite of the stifling heat), she left\r\nhim altogether for some seconds and stood with her back to him. He\r\nunbuttoned his coat and freed the axe from the noose, but did not yet\r\ntake it out altogether, simply holding it in his right hand under the\r\ncoat. His hands were fearfully weak, he felt them every moment growing\r\nmore numb and more wooden. He was afraid he would let the axe slip and\r\nfall.... A sudden giddiness came over him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what has he tied it up like this for?\xe2\x80\x9d the old woman cried with\r\nvexation and moved towards him.\r\n\r\nHe had not a minute more to lose. He pulled the axe quite out, swung\r\nit with both arms, scarcely conscious of himself, and almost without\r\neffort, almost mechanically, brought the blunt side down on her head. He\r\nseemed not to use his own strength in this. But as soon as he had once\r\nbrought the axe down, his strength returned to him.\r\n\r\nThe old woman was as always bareheaded. Her thin, light hair, streaked\r\nwith grey, thickly smeared with grease, was plaited in a rat\xe2\x80\x99s tail and\r\nfastened by a broken horn comb which stood out on the nape of her neck.\r\nAs she was so short, the blow fell on the very top of her skull. She\r\ncried out, but very faintly, and suddenly sank all of a heap on the\r\nfloor, raising her hands to her head. In one hand she still held \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\npledge.\xe2\x80\x9d Then he dealt her another and another blow with the blunt side\r\nand on the same spot. The blood gushed as from an overturned glass, the\r\nbody fell back. He stepped back, let it fall, and at once bent over her\r\nface; she was dead. Her eyes seemed to be starting out of their sockets,\r\nthe brow and the whole face were drawn and contorted convulsively.\r\n\r\nHe laid the axe on the ground near the dead body and felt at once in her\r\npocket (trying to avoid the streaming body)--the same right-hand pocket\r\nfrom which she had taken the key on his last visit. He was in full\r\npossession of his faculties, free from confusion or giddiness, but his\r\nhands were still trembling. He remembered afterwards that he had been\r\nparticularly collected and careful, trying all the time not to get\r\nsmeared with blood.... He pulled out the keys at once, they were all,\r\nas before, in one bunch on a steel ring. He ran at once into the bedroom\r\nwith them. It was a very small room with a whole shrine of holy images.\r\nAgainst the other wall stood a big bed, very clean and covered with\r\na silk patchwork wadded quilt. Against a third wall was a chest of\r\ndrawers. Strange to say, so soon as he began to fit the keys into the\r\nchest, so soon as he heard their jingling, a convulsive shudder passed\r\nover him. He suddenly felt tempted again to give it all up and go\r\naway. But that was only for an instant; it was too late to go back.\r\nHe positively smiled at himself, when suddenly another terrifying idea\r\noccurred to his mind. He suddenly fancied that the old woman might be\r\nstill alive and might recover her senses. Leaving the keys in the chest,\r\nhe ran back to the body, snatched up the axe and lifted it once more\r\nover the old woman, but did not bring it down. There was no doubt that\r\nshe was dead. Bending down and examining her again more closely, he saw\r\nclearly that the skull was broken and even battered in on one side. He\r\nwas about to feel it with his finger, but drew back his hand and indeed\r\nit was evident without that. Meanwhile there was a perfect pool of\r\nblood. All at once he noticed a string on her neck; he tugged at it, but\r\nthe string was strong and did not snap and besides, it was soaked\r\nwith blood. He tried to pull it out from the front of the dress, but\r\nsomething held it and prevented its coming. In his impatience he raised\r\nthe axe again to cut the string from above on the body, but did not\r\ndare, and with difficulty, smearing his hand and the axe in the blood,\r\nafter two minutes\xe2\x80\x99 hurried effort, he cut the string and took it off\r\nwithout touching the body with the axe; he was not mistaken--it was a\r\npurse. On the string were two crosses, one of Cyprus wood and one of\r\ncopper, and an image in silver filigree, and with them a small greasy\r\nchamois leather purse with a steel rim and ring. The purse was stuffed\r\nvery full; Raskolnikov thrust it in his pocket without looking at it,\r\nflung the crosses on the old woman\xe2\x80\x99s body and rushed back into the\r\nbedroom, this time taking the axe with him.\r\n\r\nHe was in terrible haste, he snatched the keys, and began trying them\r\nagain. But he was unsuccessful. They would not fit in the locks. It\r\nwas not so much that his hands were shaking, but that he kept making\r\nmistakes; though he saw for instance that a key was not the right one\r\nand would not fit, still he tried to put it in. Suddenly he remembered\r\nand realised that the big key with the deep notches, which was hanging\r\nthere with the small keys could not possibly belong to the chest of\r\ndrawers (on his last visit this had struck him), but to some strong box,\r\nand that everything perhaps was hidden in that box. He left the chest\r\nof drawers, and at once felt under the bedstead, knowing that old\r\nwomen usually keep boxes under their beds. And so it was; there was a\r\ngood-sized box under the bed, at least a yard in length, with an arched\r\nlid covered with red leather and studded with steel nails. The notched\r\nkey fitted at once and unlocked it. At the top, under a white sheet, was\r\na coat of red brocade lined with hareskin; under it was a silk dress,\r\nthen a shawl and it seemed as though there was nothing below but\r\nclothes. The first thing he did was to wipe his blood-stained hands on\r\nthe red brocade. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s red, and on red blood will be less noticeable,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n the thought passed through his mind; then he suddenly came to himself.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood God, am I going out of my senses?\xe2\x80\x9d he thought with terror.\r\n\r\nBut no sooner did he touch the clothes than a gold watch slipped from\r\nunder the fur coat. He made haste to turn them all over. There turned\r\nout to be various articles made of gold among the clothes--probably\r\nall pledges, unredeemed or waiting to be redeemed--bracelets, chains,\r\near-rings, pins and such things. Some were in cases, others simply\r\nwrapped in newspaper, carefully and exactly folded, and tied round with\r\ntape. Without any delay, he began filling up the pockets of his trousers\r\nand overcoat without examining or undoing the parcels and cases; but he\r\nhad not time to take many....\r\n\r\nHe suddenly heard steps in the room where the old woman lay. He stopped\r\nshort and was still as death. But all was quiet, so it must have been\r\nhis fancy. All at once he heard distinctly a faint cry, as though\r\nsomeone had uttered a low broken moan. Then again dead silence for\r\na minute or two. He sat squatting on his heels by the box and waited\r\nholding his breath. Suddenly he jumped up, seized the axe and ran out of\r\nthe bedroom.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the room stood Lizaveta with a big bundle in her arms.\r\nShe was gazing in stupefaction at her murdered sister, white as a sheet\r\nand seeming not to have the strength to cry out. Seeing him run out\r\nof the bedroom, she began faintly quivering all over, like a leaf, a\r\nshudder ran down her face; she lifted her hand, opened her mouth, but\r\nstill did not scream. She began slowly backing away from him into the\r\ncorner, staring intently, persistently at him, but still uttered no\r\nsound, as though she could not get breath to scream. He rushed at her\r\nwith the axe; her mouth twitched piteously, as one sees babies\xe2\x80\x99 mouths,\r\nwhen they begin to be frightened, stare intently at what frightens them\r\nand are on the point of screaming. And this hapless Lizaveta was so\r\nsimple and had been so thoroughly crushed and scared that she did not\r\neven raise a hand to guard her face, though that was the most necessary\r\nand natural action at the moment, for the axe was raised over her face.\r\nShe only put up her empty left hand, but not to her face, slowly holding\r\nit out before her as though motioning him away. The axe fell with the\r\nsharp edge just on the skull and split at one blow all the top of the\r\nhead. She fell heavily at once. Raskolnikov completely lost his head,\r\nsnatching up her bundle, dropped it again and ran into the entry.\r\n\r\nFear gained more and more mastery over him, especially after this\r\nsecond, quite unexpected murder. He longed to run away from the place\r\nas fast as possible. And if at that moment he had been capable of seeing\r\nand reasoning more correctly, if he had been able to realise all the\r\ndifficulties of his position, the hopelessness, the hideousness and the\r\nabsurdity of it, if he could have understood how many obstacles and,\r\nperhaps, crimes he had still to overcome or to commit, to get out of\r\nthat place and to make his way home, it is very possible that he would\r\nhave flung up everything, and would have gone to give himself up, and\r\nnot from fear, but from simple horror and loathing of what he had\r\ndone. The feeling of loathing especially surged up within him and grew\r\nstronger every minute. He would not now have gone to the box or even\r\ninto the room for anything in the world.\r\n\r\nBut a sort of blankness, even dreaminess, had begun by degrees to take\r\npossession of him; at moments he forgot himself, or rather, forgot what\r\nwas of importance, and caught at trifles. Glancing, however, into the\r\nkitchen and seeing a bucket half full of water on a bench, he bethought\r\nhim of washing his hands and the axe. His hands were sticky with blood.\r\nHe dropped the axe with the blade in the water, snatched a piece of soap\r\nthat lay in a broken saucer on the window, and began washing his hands\r\nin the bucket. When they were clean, he took out the axe, washed the\r\nblade and spent a long time, about three minutes, washing the wood where\r\nthere were spots of blood rubbing them with soap. Then he wiped it all\r\nwith some linen that was hanging to dry on a line in the kitchen and\r\nthen he was a long while attentively examining the axe at the window.\r\nThere was no trace left on it, only the wood was still damp. He\r\ncarefully hung the axe in the noose under his coat. Then as far as was\r\npossible, in the dim light in the kitchen, he looked over his overcoat,\r\nhis trousers and his boots. At the first glance there seemed to be\r\nnothing but stains on the boots. He wetted the rag and rubbed the boots.\r\nBut he knew he was not looking thoroughly, that there might be something\r\nquite noticeable that he was overlooking. He stood in the middle of the\r\nroom, lost in thought. Dark agonising ideas rose in his mind--the idea\r\nthat he was mad and that at that moment he was incapable of reasoning,\r\nof protecting himself, that he ought perhaps to be doing something\r\nutterly different from what he was now doing. \xe2\x80\x9cGood God!\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nmust fly, fly,\xe2\x80\x9d and he rushed into the entry. But here a shock of terror\r\nawaited him such as he had never known before.\r\n\r\nHe stood and gazed and could not believe his eyes: the door, the outer\r\ndoor from the stairs, at which he had not long before waited and rung,\r\nwas standing unfastened and at least six inches open. No lock, no bolt,\r\nall the time, all that time! The old woman had not shut it after him\r\nperhaps as a precaution. But, good God! Why, he had seen Lizaveta\r\nafterwards! And how could he, how could he have failed to reflect that\r\nshe must have come in somehow! She could not have come through the wall!\r\n\r\nHe dashed to the door and fastened the latch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut no, the wrong thing again! I must get away, get away....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe unfastened the latch, opened the door and began listening on the\r\nstaircase.\r\n\r\nHe listened a long time. Somewhere far away, it might be in the gateway,\r\ntwo voices were loudly and shrilly shouting, quarrelling and scolding.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are they about?\xe2\x80\x9d He waited patiently. At last all was still, as\r\nthough suddenly cut off; they had separated. He was meaning to go out,\r\nbut suddenly, on the floor below, a door was noisily opened and someone\r\nbegan going downstairs humming a tune. \xe2\x80\x9cHow is it they all make such\r\na noise?\xe2\x80\x9d flashed through his mind. Once more he closed the door and\r\nwaited. At last all was still, not a soul stirring. He was just taking a\r\nstep towards the stairs when he heard fresh footsteps.\r\n\r\nThe steps sounded very far off, at the very bottom of the stairs, but\r\nhe remembered quite clearly and distinctly that from the first sound he\r\nbegan for some reason to suspect that this was someone coming _there_,\r\nto the fourth floor, to the old woman. Why? Were the sounds somehow\r\npeculiar, significant? The steps were heavy, even and unhurried. Now\r\n_he_ had passed the first floor, now he was mounting higher, it was\r\ngrowing more and more distinct! He could hear his heavy breathing. And\r\nnow the third storey had been reached. Coming here! And it seemed to\r\nhim all at once that he was turned to stone, that it was like a dream\r\nin which one is being pursued, nearly caught and will be killed, and is\r\nrooted to the spot and cannot even move one\xe2\x80\x99s arms.\r\n\r\nAt last when the unknown was mounting to the fourth floor, he suddenly\r\nstarted, and succeeded in slipping neatly and quickly back into the\r\nflat and closing the door behind him. Then he took the hook and softly,\r\nnoiselessly, fixed it in the catch. Instinct helped him. When he had\r\ndone this, he crouched holding his breath, by the door. The unknown\r\nvisitor was by now also at the door. They were now standing opposite one\r\nanother, as he had just before been standing with the old woman, when\r\nthe door divided them and he was listening.\r\n\r\nThe visitor panted several times. \xe2\x80\x9cHe must be a big, fat man,\xe2\x80\x9d thought\r\nRaskolnikov, squeezing the axe in his hand. It seemed like a dream\r\nindeed. The visitor took hold of the bell and rang it loudly.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the tin bell tinkled, Raskolnikov seemed to be aware of\r\nsomething moving in the room. For some seconds he listened quite\r\nseriously. The unknown rang again, waited and suddenly tugged violently\r\nand impatiently at the handle of the door. Raskolnikov gazed in horror\r\nat the hook shaking in its fastening, and in blank terror expected every\r\nminute that the fastening would be pulled out. It certainly did seem\r\npossible, so violently was he shaking it. He was tempted to hold the\r\nfastening, but _he_ might be aware of it. A giddiness came over him\r\nagain. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall fall down!\xe2\x80\x9d flashed through his mind, but the unknown\r\nbegan to speak and he recovered himself at once.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s up? Are they asleep or murdered? D-damn them!\xe2\x80\x9d he bawled in a\r\nthick voice, \xe2\x80\x9cHey, Alyona Ivanovna, old witch! Lizaveta Ivanovna, hey,\r\nmy beauty! open the door! Oh, damn them! Are they asleep or what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd again, enraged, he tugged with all his might a dozen times at\r\nthe bell. He must certainly be a man of authority and an intimate\r\nacquaintance.\r\n\r\nAt this moment light hurried steps were heard not far off, on the\r\nstairs. Someone else was approaching. Raskolnikov had not heard them at\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t say there\xe2\x80\x99s no one at home,\xe2\x80\x9d the new-comer cried in a\r\ncheerful, ringing voice, addressing the first visitor, who still went on\r\npulling the bell. \xe2\x80\x9cGood evening, Koch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom his voice he must be quite young,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Raskolnikov.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho the devil can tell? I\xe2\x80\x99ve almost broken the lock,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Koch.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how do you come to know me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy! The day before yesterday I beat you three times running at\r\nbilliards at Gambrinus\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo they are not at home? That\xe2\x80\x99s queer. It\xe2\x80\x99s awfully stupid though.\r\nWhere could the old woman have gone? I\xe2\x80\x99ve come on business.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; and I have business with her, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what can we do? Go back, I suppose, Aie--aie! And I was hoping to\r\nget some money!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the young man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must give it up, of course, but what did she fix this time for? The\r\nold witch fixed the time for me to come herself. It\xe2\x80\x99s out of my way.\r\nAnd where the devil she can have got to, I can\xe2\x80\x99t make out. She sits here\r\nfrom year\xe2\x80\x99s end to year\xe2\x80\x99s end, the old hag; her legs are bad and yet\r\nhere all of a sudden she is out for a walk!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHadn\xe2\x80\x99t we better ask the porter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere she\xe2\x80\x99s gone and when she\xe2\x80\x99ll be back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHm.... Damn it all!... We might ask.... But you know she never does go\r\nanywhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he once more tugged at the door-handle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDamn it all. There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to be done, we must go!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStay!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the young man suddenly. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you see how the door shakes if\r\nyou pull it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat shows it\xe2\x80\x99s not locked, but fastened with the hook! Do you hear how\r\nthe hook clanks?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, don\xe2\x80\x99t you see? That proves that one of them is at home. If they\r\nwere all out, they would have locked the door from the outside with the\r\nkey and not with the hook from inside. There, do you hear how the hook\r\nis clanking? To fasten the hook on the inside they must be at home,\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t you see. So there they are sitting inside and don\xe2\x80\x99t open the\r\ndoor!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell! And so they must be!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Koch, astonished. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are they\r\nabout in there?\xe2\x80\x9d And he began furiously shaking the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStay!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the young man again. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t pull at it! There must be\r\nsomething wrong.... Here, you\xe2\x80\x99ve been ringing and pulling at the door\r\nand still they don\xe2\x80\x99t open! So either they\xe2\x80\x99ve both fainted or...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you what. Let\xe2\x80\x99s go fetch the porter, let him wake them up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBoth were going down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStay. You stop here while I run down for the porter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you\xe2\x80\x99d better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m studying the law you see! It\xe2\x80\x99s evident, e-vi-dent there\xe2\x80\x99s something\r\nwrong here!\xe2\x80\x9d the young man cried hotly, and he ran downstairs.\r\n\r\nKoch remained. Once more he softly touched the bell which gave one\r\ntinkle, then gently, as though reflecting and looking about him, began\r\ntouching the door-handle pulling it and letting it go to make sure once\r\nmore that it was only fastened by the hook. Then puffing and panting he\r\nbent down and began looking at the keyhole: but the key was in the lock\r\non the inside and so nothing could be seen.\r\n\r\nRaskolnikov stood keeping tight hold of the axe. He was in a sort of\r\ndelirium. He was even making ready to fight when they should come in.\r\nWhile they were knocking and talking together, the idea several times\r\noccurred to him to end it all at once and shout to them through the\r\ndoor. Now and then he was tempted to swear at them, to jeer at them,\r\nwhile they could not open the door! \xe2\x80\x9cOnly make haste!\xe2\x80\x9d was the thought\r\nthat flashed through his mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what the devil is he about?...\xe2\x80\x9d Time was passing, one minute, and\r\nanother--no one came. Koch began to be restless.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat the devil?\xe2\x80\x9d he cried suddenly and in impatience deserting his\r\nsentry duty, he, too, went down, hurrying and thumping with his heavy\r\nboots on the stairs. The steps died away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood heavens! What am I to do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRaskolnikov unfastened the hook, opened the door--there was no sound.\r\nAbruptly, without any thought at all, he went out, closing the door as\r\nthoroughly as he could, and went downstairs.\r\n\r\nHe had gone down three flights when he suddenly heard a loud voice\r\nbelow--where could he go! There was nowhere to hide. He was just going\r\nback to the flat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHey there! Catch the brute!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSomebody dashed out of a flat below, shouting, and rather fell than ran\r\ndown the stairs, bawling at the top of his voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMitka! Mitka! Mitka! Mitka! Mitka! Blast him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe shout ended in a shriek; the last sounds came from the yard; all was\r\nstill. But at the same instant several men talking loud and fast began\r\nnoisily mounting the stairs. There were three or four of them. He\r\ndistinguished the ringing voice of the young man. \xe2\x80\x9cHey!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFilled with despair he went straight to meet them, feeling \xe2\x80\x9ccome what\r\nmust!\xe2\x80\x9d If they stopped him--all was lost; if they let him pass--all was\r\nlost too; they would remember him. They were approaching; they were only\r\na flight from him--and suddenly deliverance! A few steps from him on the\r\nright, there was an empty flat with the door wide open, the flat on the\r\nsecond floor where the painters had been at work, and which, as though\r\nfor his benefit, they had just left. It was they, no doubt, who had just\r\nrun down, shouting. The floor had only just been painted, in the middle\r\nof the room stood a pail and a broken pot with paint and brushes. In one\r\ninstant he had whisked in at the open door and hidden behind the wall\r\nand only in the nick of time; they had already reached the landing.\r\nThen they turned and went on up to the fourth floor, talking loudly. He\r\nwaited, went out on tiptoe and ran down the stairs.\r\n\r\nNo one was on the stairs, nor in the gateway. He passed quickly through\r\nthe gateway and turned to the left in the street.\r\n\r\nHe knew, he knew perfectly well that at that moment they were at the\r\nflat, that they were greatly astonished at finding it unlocked, as\r\nthe door had just been fastened, that by now they were looking at the\r\nbodies, that before another minute had passed they would guess and\r\ncompletely realise that the murderer had just been there, and had\r\nsucceeded in hiding somewhere, slipping by them and escaping. They would\r\nguess most likely that he had been in the empty flat, while they were\r\ngoing upstairs. And meanwhile he dared not quicken his pace much, though\r\nthe next turning was still nearly a hundred yards away. \xe2\x80\x9cShould he\r\nslip through some gateway and wait somewhere in an unknown street? No,\r\nhopeless! Should he fling away the axe? Should he take a cab? Hopeless,\r\nhopeless!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt last he reached the turning. He turned down it more dead than alive.\r\nHere he was half way to safety, and he understood it; it was less risky\r\nbecause there was a great crowd of people, and he was lost in it like a\r\ngrain of sand. But all he had suffered had so weakened him that he could\r\nscarcely move. Perspiration ran down him in drops, his neck was all wet.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy word, he has been going it!\xe2\x80\x9d someone shouted at him when he came out\r\non the canal bank.\r\n\r\nHe was only dimly conscious of himself now, and the farther he went the\r\nworse it was. He remembered however, that on coming out on to the canal\r\nbank, he was alarmed at finding few people there and so being more\r\nconspicuous, and he had thought of turning back. Though he was almost\r\nfalling from fatigue, he went a long way round so as to get home from\r\nquite a different direction.\r\n\r\nHe was not fully conscious when he passed through the gateway of his\r\nhouse! He was already on the staircase before he recollected the axe.\r\nAnd yet he had a very grave problem before him, to put it back and to\r\nescape observation as far as possible in doing so. He was of course\r\nincapable of reflecting that it might perhaps be far better not to\r\nrestore the axe at all, but to drop it later on in somebody\xe2\x80\x99s yard. But\r\nit all happened fortunately, the door of the porter\xe2\x80\x99s room was closed\r\nbut not locked, so that it seemed most likely that the porter was at\r\nhome. But he had so completely lost all power of reflection that he\r\nwalked straight to the door and opened it. If the porter had asked him,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d he would perhaps have simply handed him the axe. But\r\nagain the porter was not at home, and he succeeded in putting the axe\r\nback under the bench, and even covering it with the chunk of wood as\r\nbefore. He met no one, not a soul, afterwards on the way to his room;\r\nthe landlady\xe2\x80\x99s door was shut. When he was in his room, he flung himself\r\non the sofa just as he was--he did not sleep, but sank into blank\r\nforgetfulness. If anyone had come into his room then, he would have\r\njumped up at once and screamed. Scraps and shreds of thoughts were\r\nsimply swarming in his brain, but he could not catch at one, he could\r\nnot rest on one, in spite of all his efforts....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nSo he lay a very long while. Now and then he seemed to wake up, and at\r\nsuch moments he noticed that it was far into the night, but it did not\r\noccur to him to get up. At last he noticed that it was beginning to get\r\nlight. He was lying on his back, still dazed from his recent oblivion.\r\nFearful, despairing cries rose shrilly from the street, sounds which he\r\nheard every night, indeed, under his window after two o\xe2\x80\x99clock. They woke\r\nhim up now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! the drunken men are coming out of the taverns,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npast two o\xe2\x80\x99clock,\xe2\x80\x9d and at once he leaped up, as though someone had\r\npulled him from the sofa.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! Past two o\xe2\x80\x99clock!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe sat down on the sofa--and instantly recollected everything! All at\r\nonce, in one flash, he recollected everything.\r\n\r\nFor the first moment he thought he was going mad. A dreadful chill came\r\nover him; but the chill was from the fever that had begun long before in\r\nhis sleep. Now he was suddenly taken with violent shivering, so that his\r\nteeth chattered and all his limbs were shaking. He opened the door and\r\nbegan listening--everything in the house was asleep. With amazement he\r\ngazed at himself and everything in the room around him, wondering how he\r\ncould have come in the night before without fastening the door, and have\r\nflung himself on the sofa without undressing, without even taking his\r\nhat off. It had fallen off and was lying on the floor near his pillow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf anyone had come in, what would he have thought? That I\xe2\x80\x99m drunk\r\nbut...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe rushed to the window. There was light enough, and he began hurriedly\r\nlooking himself all over from head to foot, all his clothes; were there\r\nno traces? But there was no doing it like that; shivering with cold, he\r\nbegan taking off everything and looking over again. He turned everything\r\nover to the last threads and rags, and mistrusting himself, went through\r\nhis search three times.\r\n\r\nBut there seemed to be nothing, no trace, except in one place, where\r\nsome thick drops of congealed blood were clinging to the frayed edge\r\nof his trousers. He picked up a big claspknife and cut off the frayed\r\nthreads. There seemed to be nothing more.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he remembered that the purse and the things he had taken out of\r\nthe old woman\xe2\x80\x99s box were still in his pockets! He had not thought till\r\nthen of taking them out and hiding them! He had not even thought of them\r\nwhile he was examining his clothes! What next? Instantly he rushed\r\nto take them out and fling them on the table. When he had pulled out\r\neverything, and turned the pocket inside out to be sure there was\r\nnothing left, he carried the whole heap to the corner. The paper had\r\ncome off the bottom of the wall and hung there in tatters. He began\r\nstuffing all the things into the hole under the paper: \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re in! All\r\nout of sight, and the purse too!\xe2\x80\x9d he thought gleefully, getting up and\r\ngazing blankly at the hole which bulged out more than ever. Suddenly\r\nhe shuddered all over with horror; \xe2\x80\x9cMy God!\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered in despair:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with me? Is that hidden? Is that the way to hide\r\nthings?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had not reckoned on having trinkets to hide. He had only thought of\r\nmoney, and so had not prepared a hiding-place.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut now, now, what am I glad of?\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, \xe2\x80\x9cIs that hiding things?\r\nMy reason\xe2\x80\x99s deserting me--simply!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe sat down on the sofa in exhaustion and was at once shaken by another\r\nunbearable fit of shivering. Mechanically he drew from a chair beside\r\nhim his old student\xe2\x80\x99s winter coat, which was still warm though almost in\r\nrags, covered himself up with it and once more sank into drowsiness and\r\ndelirium. He lost consciousness.\r\n\r\nNot more than five minutes had passed when he jumped up a second time,\r\nand at once pounced in a frenzy on his clothes again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow could I go to sleep again with nothing done? Yes, yes; I have not\r\ntaken the loop off the armhole! I forgot it, forgot a thing like that!\r\nSuch a piece of evidence!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe pulled off the noose, hurriedly cut it to pieces and threw the bits\r\namong his linen under the pillow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPieces of torn linen couldn\xe2\x80\x99t rouse suspicion, whatever happened; I\r\nthink not, I think not, any way!\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated, standing in the middle\r\nof the room, and with painful concentration he fell to gazing about\r\nhim again, at the floor and everywhere, trying to make sure he had not\r\nforgotten anything. The conviction that all his faculties, even memory,\r\nand the simplest power of reflection were failing him, began to be an\r\ninsufferable torture.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely it isn\xe2\x80\x99t beginning already! Surely it isn\xe2\x80\x99t my punishment coming\r\nupon me? It is!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe frayed rags he had cut off his trousers were actually lying on the\r\nfloor in the middle of the room, where anyone coming in would see them!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter with me!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried again, like one distraught.\r\n\r\nThen a strange idea entered his head; that, perhaps, all his clothes\r\nwere covered with blood, that, perhaps, there were a great many\r\nstains, but that he did not see them, did not notice them because\r\nhis perceptions were failing, were going to pieces... his reason was\r\nclouded.... Suddenly he remembered that there had been blood on the\r\npurse too. \xe2\x80\x9cAh! Then there must be blood on the pocket too, for I put\r\nthe wet purse in my pocket!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn a flash he had turned the pocket inside out and, yes!--there were\r\ntraces, stains on the lining of the pocket!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo my reason has not quite deserted me, so I still have some sense and\r\nmemory, since I guessed it of myself,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought triumphantly, with\r\na deep sigh of relief; \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s simply the weakness of fever, a moment\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndelirium,\xe2\x80\x9d and he tore the whole lining out of the left pocket of his\r\ntrousers. At that instant the sunlight fell on his left boot; on the\r\nsock which poked out from the boot, he fancied there were traces! He\r\nflung off his boots; \xe2\x80\x9ctraces indeed! The tip of the sock was soaked with\r\nblood;\xe2\x80\x9d he must have unwarily stepped into that pool.... \xe2\x80\x9cBut what am I\r\nto do with this now? Where am I to put the sock and rags and pocket?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe gathered them all up in his hands and stood in the middle of the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the stove? But they would ransack the stove first of all. Burn them?\r\nBut what can I burn them with? There are no matches even. No, better\r\ngo out and throw it all away somewhere. Yes, better throw it away,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nrepeated, sitting down on the sofa again, \xe2\x80\x9cand at once, this minute,\r\nwithout lingering...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut his head sank on the pillow instead. Again the unbearable icy\r\nshivering came over him; again he drew his coat over him.\r\n\r\nAnd for a long while, for some hours, he was haunted by the impulse to\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cgo off somewhere at once, this moment, and fling it all away, so that\r\nit may be out of sight and done with, at once, at once!\xe2\x80\x9d Several times\r\nhe tried to rise from the sofa, but could not.\r\n\r\nHe was thoroughly waked up at last by a violent knocking at his door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOpen, do, are you dead or alive? He keeps sleeping here!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted\r\nNastasya, banging with her fist on the door. \xe2\x80\x9cFor whole days together\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s snoring here like a dog! A dog he is too. Open I tell you. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npast ten.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaybe he\xe2\x80\x99s not at home,\xe2\x80\x9d said a man\xe2\x80\x99s voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa! that\xe2\x80\x99s the porter\xe2\x80\x99s voice.... What does he want?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe jumped up and sat on the sofa. The beating of his heart was a\r\npositive pain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen who can have latched the door?\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Nastasya. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s taken to\r\nbolting himself in! As if he were worth stealing! Open, you stupid, wake\r\nup!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do they want? Why the porter? All\xe2\x80\x99s discovered. Resist or open?\r\nCome what may!...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe half rose, stooped forward and unlatched the door.\r\n\r\nHis room was so small that he could undo the latch without leaving the\r\nbed. Yes; the porter and Nastasya were standing there.\r\n\r\nNastasya stared at him in a strange way. He glanced with a defiant and\r\ndesperate air at the porter, who without a word held out a grey folded\r\npaper sealed with bottle-wax.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA notice from the office,\xe2\x80\x9d he announced, as he gave him the paper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom what office?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA summons to the police office, of course. You know which office.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo the police?... What for?...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can I tell? You\xe2\x80\x99re sent for, so you go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man looked at him attentively, looked round the room and turned to\r\ngo away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s downright ill!\xe2\x80\x9d observed Nastasya, not taking her eyes off him.\r\nThe porter turned his head for a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s been in a fever since\r\nyesterday,\xe2\x80\x9d she added.\r\n\r\nRaskolnikov made no response and held the paper in his hands, without\r\nopening it. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you get up then,\xe2\x80\x9d Nastasya went on compassionately,\r\nseeing that he was letting his feet down from the sofa. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re ill, and\r\nso don\xe2\x80\x99t go; there\xe2\x80\x99s no such hurry. What have you got there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked; in his right hand he held the shreds he had cut from his\r\ntrousers, the sock, and the rags of the pocket. So he had been asleep\r\nwith them in his hand. Afterwards reflecting upon it, he remembered that\r\nhalf waking up in his fever, he had grasped all this tightly in his hand\r\nand so fallen asleep again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at the rags he\xe2\x80\x99s collected and sleeps with them, as though he has\r\ngot hold of a treasure...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Nastasya went off into her hysterical giggle.\r\n\r\nInstantly he thrust them all under his great coat and fixed his\r\neyes intently upon her. Far as he was from being capable of rational\r\nreflection at that moment, he felt that no one would behave like that\r\nwith a person who was going to be arrested. \xe2\x80\x9cBut... the police?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d better have some tea! Yes? I\xe2\x80\x99ll bring it, there\xe2\x80\x99s some left.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo... I\xe2\x80\x99m going; I\xe2\x80\x99ll go at once,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered, getting on to his feet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you\xe2\x80\x99ll never get downstairs!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I\xe2\x80\x99ll go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs you please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe followed the porter out.\r\n\r\nAt once he rushed to the light to examine the sock and the rags.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are stains, but not very noticeable; all covered with dirt,\r\nand rubbed and already discoloured. No one who had no suspicion could\r\ndistinguish anything. Nastasya from a distance could not have noticed,\r\nthank God!\xe2\x80\x9d Then with a tremor he broke the seal of the notice and began\r\nreading; he was a long while reading, before he understood. It was an\r\nordinary summons from the district police-station to appear that day at\r\nhalf-past nine at the office of the district superintendent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut when has such a thing happened? I never have anything to do with\r\nthe police! And why just to-day?\xe2\x80\x9d he thought in agonising bewilderment.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood God, only get it over soon!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was flinging himself on his knees to pray, but broke into\r\nlaughter--not at the idea of prayer, but at himself.\r\n\r\nHe began, hurriedly dressing. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I\xe2\x80\x99m lost, I am lost, I don\xe2\x80\x99t care!\r\nShall I put the sock on?\xe2\x80\x9d he suddenly wondered, \xe2\x80\x9cit will get dustier\r\nstill and the traces will be gone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut no sooner had he put it on than he pulled it off again in loathing\r\nand horror. He pulled it off, but reflecting that he had no other socks,\r\nhe picked it up and put it on again--and again he laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all conventional, that\xe2\x80\x99s all relative, merely a way of looking\r\nat it,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought in a flash, but only on the top surface of his\r\nmind, while he was shuddering all over, \xe2\x80\x9cthere, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got it on! I have\r\nfinished by getting it on!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut his laughter was quickly followed by despair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it\xe2\x80\x99s too much for me...\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. His legs shook. \xe2\x80\x9cFrom fear,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he muttered. His head swam and ached with fever. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a trick! They\r\nwant to decoy me there and confound me over everything,\xe2\x80\x9d he mused, as\r\nhe went out on to the stairs--\xe2\x80\x9cthe worst of it is I\xe2\x80\x99m almost\r\nlight-headed... I may blurt out something stupid...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn the stairs he remembered that he was leaving all the things just as\r\nthey were in the hole in the wall, \xe2\x80\x9cand very likely, it\xe2\x80\x99s on purpose\r\nto search when I\xe2\x80\x99m out,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, and stopped short. But he was\r\npossessed by such despair, such cynicism of misery, if one may so call\r\nit, that with a wave of his hand he went on. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly to get it over!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the street the heat was insufferable again; not a drop of rain had\r\nfallen all those days. Again dust, bricks and mortar, again the stench\r\nfrom the shops and pot-houses, again the drunken men, the Finnish\r\npedlars and half-broken-down cabs. The sun shone straight in his eyes,\r\nso that it hurt him to look out of them, and he felt his head going\r\nround--as a man in a fever is apt to feel when he comes out into the\r\nstreet on a bright sunny day.\r\n\r\nWhen he reached the turning into _the_ street, in an agony of\r\ntrepidation he looked down it... at _the_ house... and at once averted\r\nhis eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf they question me, perhaps I\xe2\x80\x99ll simply tell,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, as he drew\r\nnear the police-station.\r\n\r\nThe police-station was about a quarter of a mile off. It had lately been\r\nmoved to new rooms on the fourth floor of a new house. He had been once\r\nfor a moment in the old office but long ago. Turning in at the gateway,\r\nhe saw on the right a flight of stairs which a peasant was mounting with\r\na book in his hand. \xe2\x80\x9cA house-porter, no doubt; so then, the office is\r\nhere,\xe2\x80\x9d and he began ascending the stairs on the chance. He did not want\r\nto ask questions of anyone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go in, fall on my knees, and confess everything...\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, as\r\nhe reached the fourth floor.\r\n\r\nThe staircase was steep, narrow and all sloppy with dirty water. The\r\nkitchens of the flats opened on to the stairs and stood open almost\r\nthe whole day. So there was a fearful smell and heat. The staircase\r\nwas crowded with porters going up and down with their books under their\r\narms, policemen, and persons of all sorts and both sexes. The door of\r\nthe office, too, stood wide open. Peasants stood waiting within. There,\r\ntoo, the heat was stifling and there was a sickening smell of fresh\r\npaint and stale oil from the newly decorated rooms.\r\n\r\nAfter waiting a little, he decided to move forward into the next room.\r\nAll the rooms were small and low-pitched. A fearful impatience drew him\r\non and on. No one paid attention to him. In the second room some\r\nclerks sat writing, dressed hardly better than he was, and rather a\r\nqueer-looking set. He went up to one of them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe showed the notice he had received.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a student?\xe2\x80\x9d the man asked, glancing at the notice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, formerly a student.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe clerk looked at him, but without the slightest interest. He was a\r\nparticularly unkempt person with the look of a fixed idea in his eye.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere would be no getting anything out of him, because he has no\r\ninterest in anything,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Raskolnikov.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo in there to the head clerk,\xe2\x80\x9d said the clerk, pointing towards the\r\nfurthest room.\r\n\r\nHe went into that room--the fourth in order; it was a small room and\r\npacked full of people, rather better dressed than in the outer rooms.\r\nAmong them were two ladies. One, poorly dressed in mourning, sat at the\r\ntable opposite the chief clerk, writing something at his dictation.\r\nThe other, a very stout, buxom woman with a purplish-red, blotchy face,\r\nexcessively smartly dressed with a brooch on her bosom as big as a\r\nsaucer, was standing on one side, apparently waiting for something.\r\nRaskolnikov thrust his notice upon the head clerk. The latter glanced\r\nat it, said: \xe2\x80\x9cWait a minute,\xe2\x80\x9d and went on attending to the lady in\r\nmourning.\r\n\r\nHe breathed more freely. \xe2\x80\x9cIt can\xe2\x80\x99t be that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy degrees he began to regain confidence, he kept urging himself to have\r\ncourage and be calm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome foolishness, some trifling carelessness, and I may betray myself!\r\nHm... it\xe2\x80\x99s a pity there\xe2\x80\x99s no air here,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s stifling.... It\r\nmakes one\xe2\x80\x99s head dizzier than ever... and one\xe2\x80\x99s mind too...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was conscious of a terrible inner turmoil. He was afraid of losing\r\nhis self-control; he tried to catch at something and fix his mind on it,\r\nsomething quite irrelevant, but he could not succeed in this at all. Yet\r\nthe head clerk greatly interested him, he kept hoping to see through him\r\nand guess something from his face.\r\n\r\nHe was a very young man, about two and twenty, with a dark mobile\r\nface that looked older than his years. He was fashionably dressed and\r\nfoppish, with his hair parted in the middle, well combed and pomaded,\r\nand wore a number of rings on his well-scrubbed fingers and a gold chain\r\non his waistcoat. He said a couple of words in French to a foreigner who\r\nwas in the room, and said them fairly correctly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLuise Ivanovna, you can sit down,\xe2\x80\x9d he said casually to the\r\ngaily-dressed, purple-faced lady, who was still standing as though not\r\nventuring to sit down, though there was a chair beside her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIch danke,\xe2\x80\x9d said the latter, and softly, with a rustle of silk she sank\r\ninto the chair. Her light blue dress trimmed with white lace floated\r\nabout the table like an air-balloon and filled almost half the room. She\r\nsmelt of scent. But she was obviously embarrassed at filling half\r\nthe room and smelling so strongly of scent; and though her smile was\r\nimpudent as well as cringing, it betrayed evident uneasiness.\r\n\r\nThe lady in mourning had done at last, and got up. All at once, with\r\nsome noise, an officer walked in very jauntily, with a peculiar swing of\r\nhis shoulders at each step. He tossed his cockaded cap on the table and\r\nsat down in an easy-chair. The small lady positively skipped from her\r\nseat on seeing him, and fell to curtsying in a sort of ecstasy; but the\r\nofficer took not the smallest notice of her, and she did not venture to\r\nsit down again in his presence. He was the assistant superintendent. He\r\nhad a reddish moustache that stood out horizontally on each side of his\r\nface, and extremely small features, expressive of nothing much except\r\na certain insolence. He looked askance and rather indignantly at\r\nRaskolnikov; he was so very badly dressed, and in spite of his\r\nhumiliating position, his bearing was by no means in keeping with his\r\nclothes. Raskolnikov had unwarily fixed a very long and direct look on\r\nhim, so that he felt positively affronted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted, apparently astonished that such a ragged\r\nfellow was not annihilated by the majesty of his glance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was summoned... by a notice...\xe2\x80\x9d Raskolnikov faltered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the recovery of money due, from _the student_,\xe2\x80\x9d the head clerk\r\ninterfered hurriedly, tearing himself from his papers. \xe2\x80\x9cHere!\xe2\x80\x9d and he\r\nflung Raskolnikov a document and pointed out the place. \xe2\x80\x9cRead that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMoney? What money?\xe2\x80\x9d thought Raskolnikov, \xe2\x80\x9cbut... then... it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly\r\nnot _that_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he trembled with joy. He felt sudden intense indescribable relief. A\r\nload was lifted from his back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd pray, what time were you directed to appear, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the\r\nassistant superintendent, seeming for some unknown reason more and more\r\naggrieved. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are told to come at nine, and now it\xe2\x80\x99s twelve!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe notice was only brought me a quarter of an hour ago,\xe2\x80\x9d Raskolnikov\r\nanswered loudly over his shoulder. To his own surprise he, too, grew\r\nsuddenly angry and found a certain pleasure in it. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd it\xe2\x80\x99s enough that\r\nI have come here ill with fever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKindly refrain from shouting!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not shouting, I\xe2\x80\x99m speaking very quietly, it\xe2\x80\x99s you who are shouting\r\nat me. I\xe2\x80\x99m a student, and allow no one to shout at me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe assistant superintendent was so furious that for the first minute he\r\ncould only splutter inarticulately. He leaped up from his seat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe silent! You are in a government office. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be impudent, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re in a government office, too,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Raskolnikov, \xe2\x80\x9cand you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nsmoking a cigarette as well as shouting, so you are showing disrespect\r\nto all of us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe felt an indescribable satisfaction at having said this.\r\n\r\nThe head clerk looked at him with a smile. The angry assistant\r\nsuperintendent was obviously disconcerted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s not your business!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted at last with unnatural loudness.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKindly make the declaration demanded of you. Show him. Alexandr\r\nGrigorievitch. There is a complaint against you! You don\xe2\x80\x99t pay your\r\ndebts! You\xe2\x80\x99re a fine bird!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Raskolnikov was not listening now; he had eagerly clutched at the\r\npaper, in haste to find an explanation. He read it once, and a second\r\ntime, and still did not understand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is this?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked the head clerk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is for the recovery of money on an I O U, a writ. You must\r\neither pay it, with all expenses, costs and so on, or give a written\r\ndeclaration when you can pay it, and at the same time an undertaking not\r\nto leave the capital without payment, and nor to sell or conceal your\r\nproperty. The creditor is at liberty to sell your property, and proceed\r\nagainst you according to the law.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I... am not in debt to anyone!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s not our business. Here, an I O U for a hundred and fifteen\r\nroubles, legally attested, and due for payment, has been brought us\r\nfor recovery, given by you to the widow of the assessor Zarnitsyn, nine\r\nmonths ago, and paid over by the widow Zarnitsyn to one Mr. Tchebarov.\r\nWe therefore summon you, hereupon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut she is my landlady!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what if she is your landlady?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe head clerk looked at him with a condescending smile of compassion,\r\nand at the same time with a certain triumph, as at a novice under fire\r\nfor the first time--as though he would say: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, how do you feel now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n But what did he care now for an I O U, for a writ of recovery! Was that\r\nworth worrying about now, was it worth attention even! He stood, he\r\nread, he listened, he answered, he even asked questions himself, but\r\nall mechanically. The triumphant sense of security, of deliverance from\r\noverwhelming danger, that was what filled his whole soul that moment\r\nwithout thought for the future, without analysis, without suppositions\r\nor surmises, without doubts and without questioning. It was an instant\r\nof full, direct, purely instinctive joy. But at that very moment\r\nsomething like a thunderstorm took place in the office. The assistant\r\nsuperintendent, still shaken by Raskolnikov\xe2\x80\x99s disrespect, still fuming\r\nand obviously anxious to keep up his wounded dignity, pounced on the\r\nunfortunate smart lady, who had been gazing at him ever since he came in\r\nwith an exceedingly silly smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shameful hussy!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted suddenly at the top of his voice. (The\r\nlady in mourning had left the office.) \xe2\x80\x9cWhat was going on at your house\r\nlast night? Eh! A disgrace again, you\xe2\x80\x99re a scandal to the whole street.\r\nFighting and drinking again. Do you want the house of correction? Why,\r\nI have warned you ten times over that I would not let you off the\r\neleventh! And here you are again, again, you... you...!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe paper fell out of Raskolnikov\xe2\x80\x99s hands, and he looked wildly at the\r\nsmart lady who was so unceremoniously treated. But he soon saw what it\r\nmeant, and at once began to find positive amusement in the scandal. He\r\nlistened with pleasure, so that he longed to laugh and laugh... all his\r\nnerves were on edge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIlya Petrovitch!\xe2\x80\x9d the head clerk was beginning anxiously, but stopped\r\nshort, for he knew from experience that the enraged assistant could not\r\nbe stopped except by force.\r\n\r\nAs for the smart lady, at first she positively trembled before the\r\nstorm. But, strange to say, the more numerous and violent the terms of\r\nabuse became, the more amiable she looked, and the more seductive the\r\nsmiles she lavished on the terrible assistant. She moved uneasily, and\r\ncurtsied incessantly, waiting impatiently for a chance of putting in her\r\nword: and at last she found it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was no sort of noise or fighting in my house, Mr. Captain,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\npattered all at once, like peas dropping, speaking Russian confidently,\r\nthough with a strong German accent, \xe2\x80\x9cand no sort of scandal, and his\r\nhonour came drunk, and it\xe2\x80\x99s the whole truth I am telling, Mr. Captain,\r\nand I am not to blame.... Mine is an honourable house, Mr. Captain,\r\nand honourable behaviour, Mr. Captain, and I always, always dislike any\r\nscandal myself. But he came quite tipsy, and asked for three bottles\r\nagain, and then he lifted up one leg, and began playing the pianoforte\r\nwith one foot, and that is not at all right in an honourable house, and\r\nhe _ganz_ broke the piano, and it was very bad manners indeed and I said\r\nso. And he took up a bottle and began hitting everyone with it. And then\r\nI called the porter, and Karl came, and he took Karl and hit him in the\r\neye; and he hit Henriette in the eye, too, and gave me five slaps on the\r\ncheek. And it was so ungentlemanly in an honourable house, Mr. Captain,\r\nand I screamed. And he opened the window over the canal, and stood in\r\nthe window, squealing like a little pig; it was a disgrace. The idea of\r\nsquealing like a little pig at the window into the street! Fie upon him!\r\nAnd Karl pulled him away from the window by his coat, and it is true,\r\nMr. Captain, he tore _sein rock_. And then he shouted that _man muss_\r\npay him fifteen roubles damages. And I did pay him, Mr. Captain, five\r\nroubles for _sein rock_. And he is an ungentlemanly visitor and caused\r\nall the scandal. \xe2\x80\x98I will show you up,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98for I can write to all\r\nthe papers about you.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen he was an author?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Mr. Captain, and what an ungentlemanly visitor in an honourable\r\nhouse....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow then! Enough! I have told you already...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIlya Petrovitch!\xe2\x80\x9d the head clerk repeated significantly.\r\n\r\nThe assistant glanced rapidly at him; the head clerk slightly shook his\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c... So I tell you this, most respectable Luise Ivanovna, and I tell it\r\nyou for the last time,\xe2\x80\x9d the assistant went on. \xe2\x80\x9cIf there is a scandal\r\nin your honourable house once again, I will put you yourself in the\r\nlock-up, as it is called in polite society. Do you hear? So a literary\r\nman, an author took five roubles for his coat-tail in an \xe2\x80\x98honourable\r\nhouse\xe2\x80\x99? A nice set, these authors!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he cast a contemptuous glance at Raskolnikov. \xe2\x80\x9cThere was a scandal\r\nthe other day in a restaurant, too. An author had eaten his dinner and\r\nwould not pay; \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll write a satire on you,\xe2\x80\x99 says he. And there was\r\nanother of them on a steamer last week used the most disgraceful\r\nlanguage to the respectable family of a civil councillor, his wife and\r\ndaughter. And there was one of them turned out of a confectioner\xe2\x80\x99s shop\r\nthe other day. They are like that, authors, literary men, students,\r\ntown-criers.... Pfoo! You get along! I shall look in upon you myself one\r\nday. Then you had better be careful! Do you hear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith hurried deference, Luise Ivanovna fell to curtsying in all\r\ndirections, and so curtsied herself to the door. But at the door, she\r\nstumbled backwards against a good-looking officer with a fresh, open\r\nface and splendid thick fair whiskers. This was the superintendent of\r\nthe district himself, Nikodim Fomitch. Luise Ivanovna made haste\r\nto curtsy almost to the ground, and with mincing little steps, she\r\nfluttered out of the office.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAgain thunder and lightning--a hurricane!\xe2\x80\x9d said Nikodim Fomitch to Ilya\r\nPetrovitch in a civil and friendly tone. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are aroused again, you are\r\nfuming again! I heard it on the stairs!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what then!\xe2\x80\x9d Ilya Petrovitch drawled with gentlemanly nonchalance;\r\nand he walked with some papers to another table, with a jaunty swing of\r\nhis shoulders at each step. \xe2\x80\x9cHere, if you will kindly look: an author,\r\nor a student, has been one at least, does not pay his debts, has given\r\nan I O U, won\xe2\x80\x99t clear out of his room, and complaints are constantly\r\nbeing lodged against him, and here he has been pleased to make a protest\r\nagainst my smoking in his presence! He behaves like a cad himself, and\r\njust look at him, please. Here\xe2\x80\x99s the gentleman, and very attractive he\r\nis!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoverty is not a vice, my friend, but we know you go off like powder,\r\nyou can\xe2\x80\x99t bear a slight, I daresay you took offence at something and\r\nwent too far yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Nikodim Fomitch, turning affably to\r\nRaskolnikov. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you were wrong there; he is a capital fellow, I assure\r\nyou, but explosive, explosive! He gets hot, fires up, boils over, and no\r\nstopping him! And then it\xe2\x80\x99s all over! And at the bottom he\xe2\x80\x99s a heart of\r\ngold! His nickname in the regiment was the Explosive Lieutenant....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what a regiment it was, too,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Ilya Petrovitch, much gratified\r\nat this agreeable banter, though still sulky.\r\n\r\nRaskolnikov had a sudden desire to say something exceptionally pleasant\r\nto them all. \xe2\x80\x9cExcuse me, Captain,\xe2\x80\x9d he began easily, suddenly addressing\r\nNikodim Fomitch, \xe2\x80\x9cwill you enter into my position?... I am ready to\r\nask pardon, if I have been ill-mannered. I am a poor student, sick\r\nand shattered (shattered was the word he used) by poverty. I am not\r\nstudying, because I cannot keep myself now, but I shall get money.... I\r\nhave a mother and sister in the province of X. They will send it to\r\nme, and I will pay. My landlady is a good-hearted woman, but she is so\r\nexasperated at my having lost my lessons, and not paying her for the\r\nlast four months, that she does not even send up my dinner... and I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t understand this I O U at all. She is asking me to pay her on this\r\nI O U. How am I to pay her? Judge for yourselves!...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut that is not our business, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d the head clerk was observing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes. I perfectly agree with you. But allow me to explain...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Raskolnikov put in again, still addressing Nikodim Fomitch, but trying\r\nhis best to address Ilya Petrovitch also, though the latter persistently\r\nappeared to be rummaging among his papers and to be contemptuously\r\noblivious of him. \xe2\x80\x9cAllow me to explain that I have been living with her\r\nfor nearly three years and at first... at first... for why should I not\r\nconfess it, at the very beginning I promised to marry her daughter, it\r\nwas a verbal promise, freely given... she was a girl... indeed, I liked\r\nher, though I was not in love with her... a youthful affair in fact...\r\nthat is, I mean to say, that my landlady gave me credit freely in those\r\ndays, and I led a life of... I was very heedless...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody asks you for these personal details, sir, we\xe2\x80\x99ve no time to\r\nwaste,\xe2\x80\x9d Ilya Petrovitch interposed roughly and with a note of triumph;\r\nbut Raskolnikov stopped him hotly, though he suddenly found it\r\nexceedingly difficult to speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut excuse me, excuse me. It is for me to explain... how it all\r\nhappened... In my turn... though I agree with you... it is unnecessary.\r\nBut a year ago, the girl died of typhus. I remained lodging there as\r\nbefore, and when my landlady moved into her present quarters, she said\r\nto me... and in a friendly way... that she had complete trust in me,\r\nbut still, would I not give her an I O U for one hundred and fifteen\r\nroubles, all the debt I owed her. She said if only I gave her that,\r\nshe would trust me again, as much as I liked, and that she would never,\r\nnever--those were her own words--make use of that I O U till I could pay\r\nof myself... and now, when I have lost my lessons and have nothing to\r\neat, she takes action against me. What am I to say to that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll these affecting details are no business of ours.\xe2\x80\x9d Ilya Petrovitch\r\ninterrupted rudely. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must give a written undertaking but as for your\r\nlove affairs and all these tragic events, we have nothing to do with\r\nthat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome now... you are harsh,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Nikodim Fomitch, sitting down at\r\nthe table and also beginning to write. He looked a little ashamed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWrite!\xe2\x80\x9d said the head clerk to Raskolnikov.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWrite what?\xe2\x80\x9d the latter asked, gruffly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will dictate to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRaskolnikov fancied that the head clerk treated him more casually and\r\ncontemptuously after his speech, but strange to say he suddenly felt\r\ncompletely indifferent to anyone\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, and this revulsion took\r\nplace in a flash, in one instant. If he had cared to think a little,\r\nhe would have been amazed indeed that he could have talked to them like\r\nthat a minute before, forcing his feelings upon them. And where had\r\nthose feelings come from? Now if the whole room had been filled, not\r\nwith police officers, but with those nearest and dearest to him, he\r\nwould not have found one human word for them, so empty was his heart. A\r\ngloomy sensation of agonising, everlasting solitude and remoteness, took\r\nconscious form in his soul. It was not the meanness of his sentimental\r\neffusions before Ilya Petrovitch, nor the meanness of the latter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntriumph over him that had caused this sudden revulsion in his heart.\r\nOh, what had he to do now with his own baseness, with all these petty\r\nvanities, officers, German women, debts, police-offices? If he had been\r\nsentenced to be burnt at that moment, he would not have stirred, would\r\nhardly have heard the sentence to the end. Something was happening to\r\nhim entirely new, sudden and unknown. It was not that he understood, but\r\nhe felt clearly with all the intensity of sensation that he could\r\nnever more appeal to these people in the police-office with sentimental\r\neffusions like his recent outburst, or with anything whatever; and that\r\nif they had been his own brothers and sisters and not police-officers,\r\nit would have been utterly out of the question to appeal to them in any\r\ncircumstance of life. He had never experienced such a strange and awful\r\nsensation. And what was most agonising--it was more a sensation than a\r\nconception or idea, a direct sensation, the most agonising of all the\r\nsensations he had known in his life.\r\n\r\nThe head clerk began dictating to him the usual form of declaration,\r\nthat he could not pay, that he undertook to do so at a future date, that\r\nhe would not leave the town, nor sell his property, and so on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you can\xe2\x80\x99t write, you can hardly hold the pen,\xe2\x80\x9d observed the head\r\nclerk, looking with curiosity at Raskolnikov. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you ill?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I am giddy. Go on!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all. Sign it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe head clerk took the paper, and turned to attend to others.\r\n\r\nRaskolnikov gave back the pen; but instead of getting up and going away,\r\nhe put his elbows on the table and pressed his head in his hands. He\r\nfelt as if a nail were being driven into his skull. A strange idea\r\nsuddenly occurred to him, to get up at once, to go up to Nikodim\r\nFomitch, and tell him everything that had happened yesterday, and then\r\nto go with him to his lodgings and to show him the things in the hole\r\nin the corner. The impulse was so strong that he got up from his seat\r\nto carry it out. \xe2\x80\x9cHadn\xe2\x80\x99t I better think a minute?\xe2\x80\x9d flashed through his\r\nmind. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, better cast off the burden without thinking.\xe2\x80\x9d But all at once\r\nhe stood still, rooted to the spot. Nikodim Fomitch was talking eagerly\r\nwith Ilya Petrovitch, and the words reached him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s impossible, they\xe2\x80\x99ll both be released. To begin with, the whole\r\nstory contradicts itself. Why should they have called the porter, if it\r\nhad been their doing? To inform against themselves? Or as a blind? No,\r\nthat would be too cunning! Besides, Pestryakov, the student, was seen at\r\nthe gate by both the porters and a woman as he went in. He was walking\r\nwith three friends, who left him only at the gate, and he asked the\r\nporters to direct him, in the presence of the friends. Now, would he\r\nhave asked his way if he had been going with such an object? As for\r\nKoch, he spent half an hour at the silversmith\xe2\x80\x99s below, before he went\r\nup to the old woman and he left him at exactly a quarter to eight. Now\r\njust consider...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut excuse me, how do you explain this contradiction? They state\r\nthemselves that they knocked and the door was locked; yet three minutes\r\nlater when they went up with the porter, it turned out the door was\r\nunfastened.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s just it; the murderer must have been there and bolted himself\r\nin; and they\xe2\x80\x99d have caught him for a certainty if Koch had not been\r\nan ass and gone to look for the porter too. _He_ must have seized the\r\ninterval to get downstairs and slip by them somehow. Koch keeps crossing\r\nhimself and saying: \xe2\x80\x98If I had been there, he would have jumped out and\r\nkilled me with his axe.\xe2\x80\x99 He is going to have a thanksgiving service--ha,\r\nha!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd no one saw the murderer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey might well not see him; the house is a regular Noah\xe2\x80\x99s Ark,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe head clerk, who was listening.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s clear, quite clear,\xe2\x80\x9d Nikodim Fomitch repeated warmly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it is anything but clear,\xe2\x80\x9d Ilya Petrovitch maintained.\r\n\r\nRaskolnikov picked up his hat and walked towards the door, but he did\r\nnot reach it....\r\n\r\nWhen he recovered consciousness, he found himself sitting in a chair,\r\nsupported by someone on the right side, while someone else was standing\r\non the left, holding a yellowish glass filled with yellow water, and\r\nNikodim Fomitch standing before him, looking intently at him. He got up\r\nfrom the chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s this? Are you ill?\xe2\x80\x9d Nikodim Fomitch asked, rather sharply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe could hardly hold his pen when he was signing,\xe2\x80\x9d said the head clerk,\r\nsettling back in his place, and taking up his work again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you been ill long?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Ilya Petrovitch from his place, where\r\nhe, too, was looking through papers. He had, of course, come to look at\r\nthe sick man when he fainted, but retired at once when he recovered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSince yesterday,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Raskolnikov in reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you go out yesterday?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThough you were ill?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt what time?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout seven.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd where did you go, may I ask?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlong the street.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShort and clear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRaskolnikov, white as a handkerchief, had answered sharply, jerkily,\r\nwithout dropping his black feverish eyes before Ilya Petrovitch\xe2\x80\x99s stare.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe can scarcely stand upright. And you...\xe2\x80\x9d Nikodim Fomitch was\r\nbeginning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo matter,\xe2\x80\x9d Ilya Petrovitch pronounced rather peculiarly.\r\n\r\nNikodim Fomitch would have made some further protest, but glancing at\r\nthe head clerk who was looking very hard at him, he did not speak. There\r\nwas a sudden silence. It was strange.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, then,\xe2\x80\x9d concluded Ilya Petrovitch, \xe2\x80\x9cwe will not detain you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRaskolnikov went out. He caught the sound of eager conversation on his\r\ndeparture, and above the rest rose the questioning voice of Nikodim\r\nFomitch. In the street, his faintness passed off completely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA search--there will be a search at once,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated to himself,\r\nhurrying home. \xe2\x80\x9cThe brutes! they suspect.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis former terror mastered him completely again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what if there has been a search already? What if I find them in my\r\nroom?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut here was his room. Nothing and no one in it. No one had peeped in.\r\nEven Nastasya had not touched it. But heavens! how could he have left\r\nall those things in the hole?\r\n\r\nHe rushed to the corner, slipped his hand under the paper, pulled the\r\nthings out and lined his pockets with them. There were eight articles in\r\nall: two little boxes with ear-rings or something of the sort, he hardly\r\nlooked to see; then four small leather cases. There was a chain, too,\r\nmerely wrapped in newspaper and something else in newspaper, that looked\r\nlike a decoration.... He put them all in the different pockets of his\r\novercoat, and the remaining pocket of his trousers, trying to conceal\r\nthem as much as possible. He took the purse, too. Then he went out of\r\nhis room, leaving the door open. He walked quickly and resolutely, and\r\nthough he felt shattered, he had his senses about him. He was afraid of\r\npursuit, he was afraid that in another half-hour, another quarter of an\r\nhour perhaps, instructions would be issued for his pursuit, and so at\r\nall costs, he must hide all traces before then. He must clear everything\r\nup while he still had some strength, some reasoning power left him....\r\nWhere was he to go?\r\n\r\nThat had long been settled: \xe2\x80\x9cFling them into the canal, and all traces\r\nhidden in the water, the thing would be at an end.\xe2\x80\x9d So he had decided in\r\nthe night of his delirium when several times he had had the impulse to\r\nget up and go away, to make haste, and get rid of it all. But to get\r\nrid of it, turned out to be a very difficult task. He wandered along\r\nthe bank of the Ekaterininsky Canal for half an hour or more and looked\r\nseveral times at the steps running down to the water, but he could not\r\nthink of carrying out his plan; either rafts stood at the steps\xe2\x80\x99 edge,\r\nand women were washing clothes on them, or boats were moored there, and\r\npeople were swarming everywhere. Moreover he could be seen and noticed\r\nfrom the banks on all sides; it would look suspicious for a man to go\r\ndown on purpose, stop, and throw something into the water. And what if\r\nthe boxes were to float instead of sinking? And of course they would.\r\nEven as it was, everyone he met seemed to stare and look round, as if\r\nthey had nothing to do but to watch him. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy is it, or can it be my\r\nfancy?\xe2\x80\x9d he thought.\r\n\r\nAt last the thought struck him that it might be better to go to the\r\nNeva. There were not so many people there, he would be less observed,\r\nand it would be more convenient in every way, above all it was further\r\noff. He wondered how he could have been wandering for a good half-hour,\r\nworried and anxious in this dangerous past without thinking of it\r\nbefore. And that half-hour he had lost over an irrational plan, simply\r\nbecause he had thought of it in delirium! He had become extremely absent\r\nand forgetful and he was aware of it. He certainly must make haste.\r\n\r\nHe walked towards the Neva along V---- Prospect, but on the way\r\nanother idea struck him. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy to the Neva? Would it not be better to go\r\nsomewhere far off, to the Islands again, and there hide the things\r\nin some solitary place, in a wood or under a bush, and mark the spot\r\nperhaps?\xe2\x80\x9d And though he felt incapable of clear judgment, the idea\r\nseemed to him a sound one. But he was not destined to go there. For\r\ncoming out of V---- Prospect towards the square, he saw on the left a\r\npassage leading between two blank walls to a courtyard. On the right\r\nhand, the blank unwhitewashed wall of a four-storied house stretched far\r\ninto the court; on the left, a wooden hoarding ran parallel with it for\r\ntwenty paces into the court, and then turned sharply to the left. Here\r\nwas a deserted fenced-off place where rubbish of different sorts was\r\nlying. At the end of the court, the corner of a low, smutty, stone shed,\r\napparently part of some workshop, peeped from behind the hoarding. It\r\nwas probably a carriage builder\xe2\x80\x99s or carpenter\xe2\x80\x99s shed; the whole place\r\nfrom the entrance was black with coal dust. Here would be the place to\r\nthrow it, he thought. Not seeing anyone in the yard, he slipped in, and\r\nat once saw near the gate a sink, such as is often put in yards where\r\nthere are many workmen or cab-drivers; and on the hoarding above had\r\nbeen scribbled in chalk the time-honoured witticism, \xe2\x80\x9cStanding here\r\nstrictly forbidden.\xe2\x80\x9d This was all the better, for there would be nothing\r\nsuspicious about his going in. \xe2\x80\x9cHere I could throw it all in a heap and\r\nget away!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLooking round once more, with his hand already in his pocket, he noticed\r\nagainst the outer wall, between the entrance and the sink, a big unhewn\r\nstone, weighing perhaps sixty pounds. The other side of the wall was a\r\nstreet. He could hear passers-by, always numerous in that part, but he\r\ncould not be seen from the entrance, unless someone came in from the\r\nstreet, which might well happen indeed, so there was need of haste.\r\n\r\nHe bent down over the stone, seized the top of it firmly in both hands,\r\nand using all his strength turned it over. Under the stone was a small\r\nhollow in the ground, and he immediately emptied his pocket into it.\r\nThe purse lay at the top, and yet the hollow was not filled up. Then he\r\nseized the stone again and with one twist turned it back, so that it was\r\nin the same position again, though it stood a very little higher. But\r\nhe scraped the earth about it and pressed it at the edges with his foot.\r\nNothing could be noticed.\r\n\r\nThen he went out, and turned into the square. Again an intense,\r\nalmost unbearable joy overwhelmed him for an instant, as it had in\r\nthe police-office. \xe2\x80\x9cI have buried my tracks! And who, who can think of\r\nlooking under that stone? It has been lying there most likely ever since\r\nthe house was built, and will lie as many years more. And if it were\r\nfound, who would think of me? It is all over! No clue!\xe2\x80\x9d And he laughed.\r\nYes, he remembered that he began laughing a thin, nervous noiseless\r\nlaugh, and went on laughing all the time he was crossing the square. But\r\nwhen he reached the K---- Boulevard where two days before he had come\r\nupon that girl, his laughter suddenly ceased. Other ideas crept into his\r\nmind. He felt all at once that it would be loathsome to pass that seat\r\non which after the girl was gone, he had sat and pondered, and that it\r\nwould be hateful, too, to meet that whiskered policeman to whom he had\r\ngiven the twenty copecks: \xe2\x80\x9cDamn him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe walked, looking about him angrily and distractedly. All his ideas now\r\nseemed to be circling round some single point, and he felt that there\r\nreally was such a point, and that now, now, he was left facing that\r\npoint--and for the first time, indeed, during the last two months.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDamn it all!\xe2\x80\x9d he thought suddenly, in a fit of ungovernable fury.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it has begun, then it has begun. Hang the new life! Good Lord, how\r\nstupid it is!... And what lies I told to-day! How despicably I fawned\r\nupon that wretched Ilya Petrovitch! But that is all folly! What do I\r\ncare for them all, and my fawning upon them! It is not that at all! It\r\nis not that at all!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuddenly he stopped; a new utterly unexpected and exceedingly simple\r\nquestion perplexed and bitterly confounded him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it all has really been done deliberately and not idiotically, if\r\nI really had a certain and definite object, how is it I did not even\r\nglance into the purse and don\xe2\x80\x99t know what I had there, for which I have\r\nundergone these agonies, and have deliberately undertaken this base,\r\nfilthy degrading business? And here I wanted at once to throw into the\r\nwater the purse together with all the things which I had not seen\r\neither... how\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYes, that was so, that was all so. Yet he had known it all before, and\r\nit was not a new question for him, even when it was decided in the night\r\nwithout hesitation and consideration, as though so it must be, as though\r\nit could not possibly be otherwise.... Yes, he had known it all, and\r\nunderstood it all; it surely had all been settled even yesterday at the\r\nmoment when he was bending over the box and pulling the jewel-cases out\r\nof it.... Yes, so it was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is because I am very ill,\xe2\x80\x9d he decided grimly at last, \xe2\x80\x9cI have been\r\nworrying and fretting myself, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what I am doing....\r\nYesterday and the day before yesterday and all this time I have been\r\nworrying myself.... I shall get well and I shall not worry.... But what\r\nif I don\xe2\x80\x99t get well at all? Good God, how sick I am of it all!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe walked on without resting. He had a terrible longing for some\r\ndistraction, but he did not know what to do, what to attempt. A new\r\noverwhelming sensation was gaining more and more mastery over him\r\nevery moment; this was an immeasurable, almost physical, repulsion for\r\neverything surrounding him, an obstinate, malignant feeling of hatred.\r\nAll who met him were loathsome to him--he loathed their faces, their\r\nmovements, their gestures. If anyone had addressed him, he felt that he\r\nmight have spat at him or bitten him....\r\n\r\nHe stopped suddenly, on coming out on the bank of the Little Neva, near\r\nthe bridge to Vassilyevsky Ostrov. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, he lives here, in that house,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he thought, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy, I have not come to Razumihin of my own accord! Here\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s the same thing over again.... Very interesting to know, though;\r\nhave I come on purpose or have I simply walked here by chance? Never\r\nmind, I said the day before yesterday that I would go and see him the\r\nday _after_; well, and so I will! Besides I really cannot go further\r\nnow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe went up to Razumihin\xe2\x80\x99s room on the fifth floor.\r\n\r\nThe latter was at home in his garret, busily writing at the moment, and\r\nhe opened the door himself. It was four months since they had seen each\r\nother. Razumihin was sitting in a ragged dressing-gown, with slippers on\r\nhis bare feet, unkempt, unshaven and unwashed. His face showed surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it you?\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. He looked his comrade up and down; then after a\r\nbrief pause, he whistled. \xe2\x80\x9cAs hard up as all that! Why, brother, you\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ncut me out!\xe2\x80\x9d he added, looking at Raskolnikov\xe2\x80\x99s rags. \xe2\x80\x9cCome sit down,\r\nyou are tired, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be bound.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd when he had sunk down on the American leather sofa, which was\r\nin even worse condition than his own, Razumihin saw at once that his\r\nvisitor was ill.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you are seriously ill, do you know that?\xe2\x80\x9d He began feeling his\r\npulse. Raskolnikov pulled away his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI have come for this: I have no lessons.... I\r\nwanted,... but I don\xe2\x80\x99t really want lessons....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I say! You are delirious, you know!\xe2\x80\x9d Razumihin observed, watching\r\nhim carefully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I am not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRaskolnikov got up from the sofa. As he had mounted the stairs to\r\nRazumihin\xe2\x80\x99s, he had not realised that he would be meeting his friend\r\nface to face. Now, in a flash, he knew, that what he was least of all\r\ndisposed for at that moment was to be face to face with anyone in the\r\nwide world. His spleen rose within him. He almost choked with rage at\r\nhimself as soon as he crossed Razumihin\xe2\x80\x99s threshold.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye,\xe2\x80\x9d he said abruptly, and walked to the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop, stop! You queer fish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other, again pulling away his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen why the devil have you come? Are you mad, or what? Why, this\r\nis... almost insulting! I won\xe2\x80\x99t let you go like that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, I came to you because I know no one but you who could\r\nhelp... to begin... because you are kinder than anyone--cleverer, I\r\nmean, and can judge... and now I see that I want nothing. Do you hear?\r\nNothing at all... no one\xe2\x80\x99s services... no one\xe2\x80\x99s sympathy. I am by\r\nmyself... alone. Come, that\xe2\x80\x99s enough. Leave me alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStay a minute, you sweep! You are a perfect madman. As you like for all\r\nI care. I have no lessons, do you see, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t care about that, but\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s a bookseller, Heruvimov--and he takes the place of a lesson.\r\nI would not exchange him for five lessons. He\xe2\x80\x99s doing publishing of a\r\nkind, and issuing natural science manuals and what a circulation they\r\nhave! The very titles are worth the money! You always maintained that I\r\nwas a fool, but by Jove, my boy, there are greater fools than I am!\r\nNow he is setting up for being advanced, not that he has an inkling of\r\nanything, but, of course, I encourage him. Here are two signatures of\r\nthe German text--in my opinion, the crudest charlatanism; it discusses\r\nthe question, \xe2\x80\x98Is woman a human being?\xe2\x80\x99 And, of course, triumphantly\r\nproves that she is. Heruvimov is going to bring out this work as a\r\ncontribution to the woman question; I am translating it; he will expand\r\nthese two and a half signatures into six, we shall make up a gorgeous\r\ntitle half a page long and bring it out at half a rouble. It will do! He\r\npays me six roubles the signature, it works out to about fifteen roubles\r\nfor the job, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve had six already in advance. When we have finished\r\nthis, we are going to begin a translation about whales, and then some of\r\nthe dullest scandals out of the second part of _Les Confessions_ we have\r\nmarked for translation; somebody has told Heruvimov, that Rousseau was\r\na kind of Radishchev. You may be sure I don\xe2\x80\x99t contradict him, hang him!\r\nWell, would you like to do the second signature of \xe2\x80\x98_Is woman a human\r\nbeing?_\xe2\x80\x99 If you would, take the German and pens and paper--all those\r\nare provided, and take three roubles; for as I have had six roubles in\r\nadvance on the whole thing, three roubles come to you for your share.\r\nAnd when you have finished the signature there will be another three\r\nroubles for you. And please don\xe2\x80\x99t think I am doing you a service; quite\r\nthe contrary, as soon as you came in, I saw how you could help me; to\r\nbegin with, I am weak in spelling, and secondly, I am sometimes utterly\r\nadrift in German, so that I make it up as I go along for the most part.\r\nThe only comfort is, that it\xe2\x80\x99s bound to be a change for the better.\r\nThough who can tell, maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s sometimes for the worse. Will you take\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRaskolnikov took the German sheets in silence, took the three roubles\r\nand without a word went out. Razumihin gazed after him in astonishment.\r\nBut when Raskolnikov was in the next street, he turned back, mounted the\r\nstairs to Razumihin\xe2\x80\x99s again and laying on the table the German article\r\nand the three roubles, went out again, still without uttering a word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you raving, or what?\xe2\x80\x9d Razumihin shouted, roused to fury at last.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat farce is this? You\xe2\x80\x99ll drive me crazy too... what did you come to\r\nsee me for, damn you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want... translation,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Raskolnikov from the stairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen what the devil do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Razumihin from above.\r\nRaskolnikov continued descending the staircase in silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHey, there! Where are you living?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, confound you then!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Raskolnikov was already stepping into the street. On the Nikolaevsky\r\nBridge he was roused to full consciousness again by an unpleasant\r\nincident. A coachman, after shouting at him two or three times, gave him\r\na violent lash on the back with his whip, for having almost fallen under\r\nhis horses\xe2\x80\x99 hoofs. The lash so infuriated him that he dashed away to the\r\nrailing (for some unknown reason he had been walking in the very middle\r\nof the bridge in the traffic). He angrily clenched and ground his teeth.\r\nHe heard laughter, of course.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cServes him right!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA pickpocket I dare say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPretending to be drunk, for sure, and getting under the wheels on\r\npurpose; and you have to answer for him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a regular profession, that\xe2\x80\x99s what it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut while he stood at the railing, still looking angry and bewildered\r\nafter the retreating carriage, and rubbing his back, he suddenly felt\r\nsomeone thrust money into his hand. He looked. It was an elderly woman\r\nin a kerchief and goatskin shoes, with a girl, probably her daughter,\r\nwearing a hat, and carrying a green parasol.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake it, my good man, in Christ\xe2\x80\x99s name.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took it and they passed on. It was a piece of twenty copecks. From\r\nhis dress and appearance they might well have taken him for a beggar\r\nasking alms in the streets, and the gift of the twenty copecks he\r\ndoubtless owed to the blow, which made them feel sorry for him.\r\n\r\nHe closed his hand on the twenty copecks, walked on for ten paces, and\r\nturned facing the Neva, looking towards the palace. The sky was without\r\na cloud and the water was almost bright blue, which is so rare in the\r\nNeva. The cupola of the cathedral, which is seen at its best from the\r\nbridge about twenty paces from the chapel, glittered in the sunlight,\r\nand in the pure air every ornament on it could be clearly distinguished.\r\nThe pain from the lash went off, and Raskolnikov forgot about it; one\r\nuneasy and not quite definite idea occupied him now completely. He stood\r\nstill, and gazed long and intently into the distance; this spot was\r\nespecially familiar to him. When he was attending the university, he had\r\nhundreds of times--generally on his way home--stood still on this spot,\r\ngazed at this truly magnificent spectacle and almost always marvelled at\r\na vague and mysterious emotion it roused in him. It left him strangely\r\ncold; this gorgeous picture was for him blank and lifeless. He wondered\r\nevery time at his sombre and enigmatic impression and, mistrusting\r\nhimself, put off finding the explanation of it. He vividly recalled\r\nthose old doubts and perplexities, and it seemed to him that it was\r\nno mere chance that he recalled them now. It struck him as strange and\r\ngrotesque, that he should have stopped at the same spot as before,\r\nas though he actually imagined he could think the same thoughts, be\r\ninterested in the same theories and pictures that had interested him...\r\nso short a time ago. He felt it almost amusing, and yet it wrung his\r\nheart. Deep down, hidden far away out of sight all that seemed to him\r\nnow--all his old past, his old thoughts, his old problems and theories,\r\nhis old impressions and that picture and himself and all, all.... He\r\nfelt as though he were flying upwards, and everything were vanishing\r\nfrom his sight. Making an unconscious movement with his hand, he\r\nsuddenly became aware of the piece of money in his fist. He opened his\r\nhand, stared at the coin, and with a sweep of his arm flung it into\r\nthe water; then he turned and went home. It seemed to him, he had cut\r\nhimself off from everyone and from everything at that moment.\r\n\r\nEvening was coming on when he reached home, so that he must have been\r\nwalking about six hours. How and where he came back he did not remember.\r\nUndressing, and quivering like an overdriven horse, he lay down on the\r\nsofa, drew his greatcoat over him, and at once sank into oblivion....\r\n\r\nIt was dusk when he was waked up by a fearful scream. Good God, what a\r\nscream! Such unnatural sounds, such howling, wailing, grinding, tears,\r\nblows and curses he had never heard.\r\n\r\nHe could never have imagined such brutality, such frenzy. In terror he\r\nsat up in bed, almost swooning with agony. But the fighting, wailing\r\nand cursing grew louder and louder. And then to his intense amazement\r\nhe caught the voice of his landlady. She was howling, shrieking and\r\nwailing, rapidly, hurriedly, incoherently, so that he could not make\r\nout what she was talking about; she was beseeching, no doubt, not to be\r\nbeaten, for she was being mercilessly beaten on the stairs. The voice of\r\nher assailant was so horrible from spite and rage that it was almost\r\na croak; but he, too, was saying something, and just as quickly\r\nand indistinctly, hurrying and spluttering. All at once Raskolnikov\r\ntrembled; he recognised the voice--it was the voice of Ilya Petrovitch.\r\nIlya Petrovitch here and beating the landlady! He is kicking her,\r\nbanging her head against the steps--that\xe2\x80\x99s clear, that can be told\r\nfrom the sounds, from the cries and the thuds. How is it, is the world\r\ntopsy-turvy? He could hear people running in crowds from all the storeys\r\nand all the staircases; he heard voices, exclamations, knocking, doors\r\nbanging. \xe2\x80\x9cBut why, why, and how could it be?\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated, thinking\r\nseriously that he had gone mad. But no, he heard too distinctly! And\r\nthey would come to him then next, \xe2\x80\x9cfor no doubt... it\xe2\x80\x99s all about\r\nthat... about yesterday.... Good God!\xe2\x80\x9d He would have fastened his door\r\nwith the latch, but he could not lift his hand... besides, it would\r\nbe useless. Terror gripped his heart like ice, tortured him and numbed\r\nhim.... But at last all this uproar, after continuing about ten minutes,\r\nbegan gradually to subside. The landlady was moaning and groaning; Ilya\r\nPetrovitch was still uttering threats and curses.... But at last he,\r\ntoo, seemed to be silent, and now he could not be heard. \xe2\x80\x9cCan he have\r\ngone away? Good Lord!\xe2\x80\x9d Yes, and now the landlady is going too, still\r\nweeping and moaning... and then her door slammed.... Now the crowd was\r\ngoing from the stairs to their rooms, exclaiming, disputing, calling\r\nto one another, raising their voices to a shout, dropping them to a\r\nwhisper. There must have been numbers of them--almost all the inmates\r\nof the block. \xe2\x80\x9cBut, good God, how could it be! And why, why had he come\r\nhere!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRaskolnikov sank worn out on the sofa, but could not close his eyes. He\r\nlay for half an hour in such anguish, such an intolerable sensation of\r\ninfinite terror as he had never experienced before. Suddenly a bright\r\nlight flashed into his room. Nastasya came in with a candle and a plate\r\nof soup. Looking at him carefully and ascertaining that he was not\r\nasleep, she set the candle on the table and began to lay out what she\r\nhad brought--bread, salt, a plate, a spoon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve eaten nothing since yesterday, I warrant. You\xe2\x80\x99ve been trudging\r\nabout all day, and you\xe2\x80\x99re shaking with fever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNastasya... what were they beating the landlady for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked intently at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho beat the landlady?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust now... half an hour ago, Ilya Petrovitch, the assistant\r\nsuperintendent, on the stairs.... Why was he ill-treating her like that,\r\nand... why was he here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNastasya scrutinised him, silent and frowning, and her scrutiny lasted a\r\nlong time. He felt uneasy, even frightened at her searching eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNastasya, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you speak?\xe2\x80\x9d he said timidly at last in a weak\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the blood,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered at last softly, as though speaking to\r\nherself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBlood? What blood?\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered, growing white and turning towards the\r\nwall.\r\n\r\nNastasya still looked at him without speaking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody has been beating the landlady,\xe2\x80\x9d she declared at last in a firm,\r\nresolute voice.\r\n\r\nHe gazed at her, hardly able to breathe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI heard it myself.... I was not asleep... I was sitting up,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid still more timidly. \xe2\x80\x9cI listened a long while. The assistant\r\nsuperintendent came.... Everyone ran out on to the stairs from all the\r\nflats.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo one has been here. That\xe2\x80\x99s the blood crying in your ears. When\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s no outlet for it and it gets clotted, you begin fancying\r\nthings.... Will you eat something?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe made no answer. Nastasya still stood over him, watching him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive me something to drink... Nastasya.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe went downstairs and returned with a white earthenware jug of water.\r\nHe remembered only swallowing one sip of the cold water and spilling\r\nsome on his neck. Then followed forgetfulness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nHe was not completely unconscious, however, all the time he was ill; he\r\nwas in a feverish state, sometimes delirious, sometimes half conscious.\r\nHe remembered a great deal afterwards. Sometimes it seemed as though\r\nthere were a number of people round him; they wanted to take him away\r\nsomewhere, there was a great deal of squabbling and discussing about\r\nhim. Then he would be alone in the room; they had all gone away afraid\r\nof him, and only now and then opened the door a crack to look at him;\r\nthey threatened him, plotted something together, laughed, and mocked\r\nat him. He remembered Nastasya often at his bedside; he distinguished\r\nanother person, too, whom he seemed to know very well, though he could\r\nnot remember who he was, and this fretted him, even made him cry.\r\nSometimes he fancied he had been lying there a month; at other times\r\nit all seemed part of the same day. But of _that_--of _that_ he had\r\nno recollection, and yet every minute he felt that he had forgotten\r\nsomething he ought to remember. He worried and tormented himself trying\r\nto remember, moaned, flew into a rage, or sank into awful, intolerable\r\nterror. Then he struggled to get up, would have run away, but someone\r\nalways prevented him by force, and he sank back into impotence and\r\nforgetfulness. At last he returned to complete consciousness.\r\n\r\nIt happened at ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning. On fine days the sun shone\r\ninto the room at that hour, throwing a streak of light on the right\r\nwall and the corner near the door. Nastasya was standing beside him\r\nwith another person, a complete stranger, who was looking at him\r\nvery inquisitively. He was a young man with a beard, wearing a full,\r\nshort-waisted coat, and looked like a messenger. The landlady was\r\npeeping in at the half-opened door. Raskolnikov sat up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is this, Nastasya?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, pointing to the young man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, he\xe2\x80\x99s himself again!\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is himself,\xe2\x80\x9d echoed the man.\r\n\r\nConcluding that he had returned to his senses, the landlady closed the\r\ndoor and disappeared. She was always shy and dreaded conversations or\r\ndiscussions. She was a woman of forty, not at all bad-looking, fat\r\nand buxom, with black eyes and eyebrows, good-natured from fatness and\r\nlaziness, and absurdly bashful.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho... are you?\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, addressing the man. But at that moment\r\nthe door was flung open, and, stooping a little, as he was so tall,\r\nRazumihin came in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a cabin it is!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. \xe2\x80\x9cI am always knocking my head. You call\r\nthis a lodging! So you are conscious, brother? I\xe2\x80\x99ve just heard the news\r\nfrom Pashenka.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has just come to,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nastasya.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust come to,\xe2\x80\x9d echoed the man again, with a smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd who are you?\xe2\x80\x9d Razumihin asked, suddenly addressing him. \xe2\x80\x9cMy name is\r\nVrazumihin, at your service; not Razumihin, as I am always called, but\r\nVrazumihin, a student and gentleman; and he is my friend. And who are\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am the messenger from our office, from the merchant Shelopaev, and\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve come on business.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease sit down.\xe2\x80\x9d Razumihin seated himself on the other side of the\r\ntable. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing you\xe2\x80\x99ve come to, brother,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on to\r\nRaskolnikov. \xe2\x80\x9cFor the last four days you have scarcely eaten or drunk\r\nanything. We had to give you tea in spoonfuls. I brought Zossimov to see\r\nyou twice. You remember Zossimov? He examined you carefully and said at\r\nonce it was nothing serious--something seemed to have gone to your head.\r\nSome nervous nonsense, the result of bad feeding, he says you have not\r\nhad enough beer and radish, but it\xe2\x80\x99s nothing much, it will pass and you\r\nwill be all right. Zossimov is a first-rate fellow! He is making quite a\r\nname. Come, I won\xe2\x80\x99t keep you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, addressing the man again. \xe2\x80\x9cWill\r\nyou explain what you want? You must know, Rodya, this is the second time\r\nthey have sent from the office; but it was another man last time, and I\r\ntalked to him. Who was it came before?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was the day before yesterday, I venture to say, if you please,\r\nsir. That was Alexey Semyonovitch; he is in our office, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was more intelligent than you, don\xe2\x80\x99t you think so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, indeed, sir, he is of more weight than I am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite so; go on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt your mamma\xe2\x80\x99s request, through Afanasy Ivanovitch Vahrushin, of whom\r\nI presume you have heard more than once, a remittance is sent to you\r\nfrom our office,\xe2\x80\x9d the man began, addressing Raskolnikov. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you are in\r\nan intelligible condition, I\xe2\x80\x99ve thirty-five roubles to remit to you, as\r\nSemyon Semyonovitch has received from Afanasy Ivanovitch at your mamma\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrequest instructions to that effect, as on previous occasions. Do you\r\nknow him, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I remember... Vahrushin,\xe2\x80\x9d Raskolnikov said dreamily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou hear, he knows Vahrushin,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Razumihin. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is in \xe2\x80\x98an\r\nintelligible condition\xe2\x80\x99! And I see you are an intelligent man too. Well,\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s always pleasant to hear words of wisdom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the gentleman, Vahrushin, Afanasy Ivanovitch. And at the request\r\nof your mamma, who has sent you a remittance once before in the\r\nsame manner through him, he did not refuse this time also, and sent\r\ninstructions to Semyon Semyonovitch some days since to hand you\r\nthirty-five roubles in the hope of better to come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat \xe2\x80\x98hoping for better to come\xe2\x80\x99 is the best thing you\xe2\x80\x99ve said, though\r\n\xe2\x80\x98your mamma\xe2\x80\x99 is not bad either. Come then, what do you say? Is he fully\r\nconscious, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all right. If only he can sign this little paper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe can scrawl his name. Have you got the book?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, here\xe2\x80\x99s the book.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive it to me. Here, Rodya, sit up. I\xe2\x80\x99ll hold you. Take the pen and\r\nscribble \xe2\x80\x98Raskolnikov\xe2\x80\x99 for him. For just now, brother, money is sweeter\r\nto us than treacle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Raskolnikov, pushing away the pen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot want it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t sign it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow the devil can you do without signing it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want... the money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t want the money! Come, brother, that\xe2\x80\x99s nonsense, I bear witness.\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t trouble, please, it\xe2\x80\x99s only that he is on his travels again. But\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s pretty common with him at all times though.... You are a man of\r\njudgment and we will take him in hand, that is, more simply, take his\r\nhand and he will sign it. Here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I can come another time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no. Why should we trouble you? You are a man of judgment.... Now,\r\nRodya, don\xe2\x80\x99t keep your visitor, you see he is waiting,\xe2\x80\x9d and he made\r\nready to hold Raskolnikov\xe2\x80\x99s hand in earnest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop, I\xe2\x80\x99ll do it alone,\xe2\x80\x9d said the latter, taking the pen and signing\r\nhis name.\r\n\r\nThe messenger took out the money and went away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBravo! And now, brother, are you hungry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Raskolnikov.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there any soup?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome of yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Nastasya, who was still standing there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith potatoes and rice in it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know it by heart. Bring soup and give us some tea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRaskolnikov looked at all this with profound astonishment and a dull,\r\nunreasoning terror. He made up his mind to keep quiet and see what\r\nwould happen. \xe2\x80\x9cI believe I am not wandering. I believe it\xe2\x80\x99s reality,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nthought.\r\n\r\nIn a couple of minutes Nastasya returned with the soup, and announced\r\nthat the tea would be ready directly. With the soup she brought two\r\nspoons, two plates, salt, pepper, mustard for the beef, and so on. The\r\ntable was set as it had not been for a long time. The cloth was clean.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would not be amiss, Nastasya, if Praskovya Pavlovna were to send us\r\nup a couple of bottles of beer. We could empty them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you are a cool hand,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Nastasya, and she departed to\r\ncarry out his orders.\r\n\r\nRaskolnikov still gazed wildly with strained attention. Meanwhile\r\nRazumihin sat down on the sofa beside him, as clumsily as a bear put his\r\nleft arm round Raskolnikov\xe2\x80\x99s head, although he was able to sit up, and\r\nwith his right hand gave him a spoonful of soup, blowing on it that\r\nit might not burn him. But the soup was only just warm. Raskolnikov\r\nswallowed one spoonful greedily, then a second, then a third. But after\r\ngiving him a few more spoonfuls of soup, Razumihin suddenly stopped, and\r\nsaid that he must ask Zossimov whether he ought to have more.\r\n\r\nNastasya came in with two bottles of beer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd will you have tea?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCut along, Nastasya, and bring some tea, for tea we may venture on\r\nwithout the faculty. But here is the beer!\xe2\x80\x9d He moved back to his chair,\r\npulled the soup and meat in front of him, and began eating as though he\r\nhad not touched food for three days.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must tell you, Rodya, I dine like this here every day now,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nmumbled with his mouth full of beef, \xe2\x80\x9cand it\xe2\x80\x99s all Pashenka, your dear\r\nlittle landlady, who sees to that; she loves to do anything for me. I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t ask for it, but, of course, I don\xe2\x80\x99t object. And here\xe2\x80\x99s Nastasya\r\nwith the tea. She is a quick girl. Nastasya, my dear, won\xe2\x80\x99t you have\r\nsome beer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet along with your nonsense!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA cup of tea, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA cup of tea, maybe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPour it out. Stay, I\xe2\x80\x99ll pour it out myself. Sit down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe poured out two cups, left his dinner, and sat on the sofa again. As\r\nbefore, he put his left arm round the sick man\xe2\x80\x99s head, raised him up\r\nand gave him tea in spoonfuls, again blowing each spoonful steadily and\r\nearnestly, as though this process was the principal and most effective\r\nmeans towards his friend\xe2\x80\x99s recovery. Raskolnikov said nothing and made\r\nno resistance, though he felt quite strong enough to sit up on the sofa\r\nwithout support and could not merely have held a cup or a spoon, but\r\neven perhaps could have walked about. But from some queer, almost\r\nanimal, cunning he conceived the idea of hiding his strength and lying\r\nlow for a time, pretending if necessary not to be yet in full possession\r\nof his faculties, and meanwhile listening to find out what was going on.\r\nYet he could not overcome his sense of repugnance. After sipping a dozen\r\nspoonfuls of tea, he suddenly released his head, pushed the spoon away\r\ncapriciously, and sank back on the pillow. There were actually real\r\npillows under his head now, down pillows in clean cases, he observed\r\nthat, too, and took note of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPashenka must give us some raspberry jam to-day to make him some\r\nraspberry tea,\xe2\x80\x9d said Razumihin, going back to his chair and attacking\r\nhis soup and beer again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd where is she to get raspberries for you?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Nastasya, balancing\r\na saucer on her five outspread fingers and sipping tea through a lump of\r\nsugar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99ll get it at the shop, my dear. You see, Rodya, all sorts of things\r\nhave been happening while you have been laid up. When you decamped in\r\nthat rascally way without leaving your address, I felt so angry that I\r\nresolved to find you out and punish you. I set to work that very day.\r\nHow I ran about making inquiries for you! This lodging of yours I had\r\nforgotten, though I never remembered it, indeed, because I did not know\r\nit; and as for your old lodgings, I could only remember it was at the\r\nFive Corners, Harlamov\xe2\x80\x99s house. I kept trying to find that Harlamov\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhouse, and afterwards it turned out that it was not Harlamov\xe2\x80\x99s, but\r\nBuch\xe2\x80\x99s. How one muddles up sound sometimes! So I lost my temper, and I\r\nwent on the chance to the address bureau next day, and only fancy, in\r\ntwo minutes they looked you up! Your name is down there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy name!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should think so; and yet a General Kobelev they could not find while\r\nI was there. Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s a long story. But as soon as I did land on this\r\nplace, I soon got to know all your affairs--all, all, brother, I know\r\neverything; Nastasya here will tell you. I made the acquaintance of\r\nNikodim Fomitch and Ilya Petrovitch, and the house-porter and Mr.\r\nZametov, Alexandr Grigorievitch, the head clerk in the police office,\r\nand, last, but not least, of Pashenka; Nastasya here knows....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s got round her,\xe2\x80\x9d Nastasya murmured, smiling slyly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you put the sugar in your tea, Nastasya Nikiforovna?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a one!\xe2\x80\x9d Nastasya cried suddenly, going off into a giggle. \xe2\x80\x9cI am\r\nnot Nikiforovna, but Petrovna,\xe2\x80\x9d she added suddenly, recovering from her\r\nmirth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll make a note of it. Well, brother, to make a long story short,\r\nI was going in for a regular explosion here to uproot all malignant\r\ninfluences in the locality, but Pashenka won the day. I had not\r\nexpected, brother, to find her so... prepossessing. Eh, what do you\r\nthink?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRaskolnikov did not speak, but he still kept his eyes fixed upon him,\r\nfull of alarm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd all that could be wished, indeed, in every respect,\xe2\x80\x9d Razumihin went\r\non, not at all embarrassed by his silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, the sly dog!\xe2\x80\x9d Nastasya shrieked again. This conversation afforded\r\nher unspeakable delight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a pity, brother, that you did not set to work in the right way\r\nat first. You ought to have approached her differently. She is, so\r\nto speak, a most unaccountable character. But we will talk about her\r\ncharacter later.... How could you let things come to such a pass that\r\nshe gave up sending you your dinner? And that I O U? You must have been\r\nmad to sign an I O U. And that promise of marriage when her daughter,\r\nNatalya Yegorovna, was alive?... I know all about it! But I see that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\na delicate matter and I am an ass; forgive me. But, talking of\r\nfoolishness, do you know Praskovya Pavlovna is not nearly so foolish as\r\nyou would think at first sight?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d mumbled Raskolnikov, looking away, but feeling that it was better\r\nto keep up the conversation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe isn\xe2\x80\x99t, is she?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Razumihin, delighted to get an answer out\r\nof him. \xe2\x80\x9cBut she is not very clever either, eh? She is essentially,\r\nessentially an unaccountable character! I am sometimes quite at a loss,\r\nI assure you.... She must be forty; she says she is thirty-six, and\r\nof course she has every right to say so. But I swear I judge her\r\nintellectually, simply from the metaphysical point of view; there is a\r\nsort of symbolism sprung up between us, a sort of algebra or what not!\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t understand it! Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s all nonsense. Only, seeing that you\r\nare not a student now and have lost your lessons and your clothes, and\r\nthat through the young lady\xe2\x80\x99s death she has no need to treat you as\r\na relation, she suddenly took fright; and as you hid in your den and\r\ndropped all your old relations with her, she planned to get rid of you.\r\nAnd she\xe2\x80\x99s been cherishing that design a long time, but was sorry to lose\r\nthe I O U, for you assured her yourself that your mother would pay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was base of me to say that.... My mother herself is almost\r\na beggar... and I told a lie to keep my lodging... and be fed,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Raskolnikov said loudly and distinctly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you did very sensibly. But the worst of it is that at that point\r\nMr. Tchebarov turns up, a business man. Pashenka would never have\r\nthought of doing anything on her own account, she is too retiring; but\r\nthe business man is by no means retiring, and first thing he puts the\r\nquestion, \xe2\x80\x98Is there any hope of realising the I O U?\xe2\x80\x99 Answer: there is,\r\nbecause he has a mother who would save her Rodya with her hundred and\r\ntwenty-five roubles pension, if she has to starve herself; and a sister,\r\ntoo, who would go into bondage for his sake. That\xe2\x80\x99s what he was building\r\nupon.... Why do you start? I know all the ins and outs of your affairs\r\nnow, my dear boy--it\xe2\x80\x99s not for nothing that you were so open with\r\nPashenka when you were her prospective son-in-law, and I say all this as\r\na friend.... But I tell you what it is; an honest and sensitive man is\r\nopen; and a business man \xe2\x80\x98listens and goes on eating\xe2\x80\x99 you up. Well,\r\nthen she gave the I O U by way of payment to this Tchebarov, and without\r\nhesitation he made a formal demand for payment. When I heard of all this\r\nI wanted to blow him up, too, to clear my conscience, but by that time\r\nharmony reigned between me and Pashenka, and I insisted on stopping\r\nthe whole affair, engaging that you would pay. I went security for you,\r\nbrother. Do you understand? We called Tchebarov, flung him ten\r\nroubles and got the I O U back from him, and here I have the honour of\r\npresenting it to you. She trusts your word now. Here, take it, you see I\r\nhave torn it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumihin put the note on the table. Raskolnikov looked at him and\r\nturned to the wall without uttering a word. Even Razumihin felt a\r\ntwinge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see, brother,\xe2\x80\x9d he said a moment later, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I have been playing the\r\nfool again. I thought I should amuse you with my chatter, and I believe\r\nI have only made you cross.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas it you I did not recognise when I was delirious?\xe2\x80\x9d Raskolnikov\r\nasked, after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s pause without turning his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and you flew into a rage about it, especially when I brought\r\nZametov one day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cZametov? The head clerk? What for?\xe2\x80\x9d Raskolnikov turned round quickly\r\nand fixed his eyes on Razumihin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with you?... What are you upset about? He wanted to\r\nmake your acquaintance because I talked to him a lot about you.... How\r\ncould I have found out so much except from him? He is a capital\r\nfellow, brother, first-rate... in his own way, of course. Now we are\r\nfriends--see each other almost every day. I have moved into this part,\r\nyou know. I have only just moved. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been with him to Luise Ivanovna\r\nonce or twice.... Do you remember Luise, Luise Ivanovna?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid I say anything in delirium?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should think so! You were beside yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did I rave about?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat next? What did you rave about? What people do rave about.... Well,\r\nbrother, now I must not lose time. To work.\xe2\x80\x9d He got up from the table\r\nand took up his cap.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did I rave about?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow he keeps on! Are you afraid of having let out some secret? Don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nworry yourself; you said nothing about a countess. But you said a lot\r\nabout a bulldog, and about ear-rings and chains, and about Krestovsky\r\nIsland, and some porter, and Nikodim Fomitch and Ilya Petrovitch, the\r\nassistant superintendent. And another thing that was of special interest\r\nto you was your own sock. You whined, \xe2\x80\x98Give me my sock.\xe2\x80\x99 Zametov\r\nhunted all about your room for your socks, and with his own scented,\r\nring-bedecked fingers he gave you the rag. And only then were you\r\ncomforted, and for the next twenty-four hours you held the wretched\r\nthing in your hand; we could not get it from you. It is most likely\r\nsomewhere under your quilt at this moment. And then you asked so\r\npiteously for fringe for your trousers. We tried to find out what sort\r\nof fringe, but we could not make it out. Now to business! Here are\r\nthirty-five roubles; I take ten of them, and shall give you an account\r\nof them in an hour or two. I will let Zossimov know at the same time,\r\nthough he ought to have been here long ago, for it is nearly twelve. And\r\nyou, Nastasya, look in pretty often while I am away, to see whether he\r\nwants a drink or anything else. And I will tell Pashenka what is wanted\r\nmyself. Good-bye!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe calls her Pashenka! Ah, he\xe2\x80\x99s a deep one!\xe2\x80\x9d said Nastasya as he went\r\nout; then she opened the door and stood listening, but could not resist\r\nrunning downstairs after him. She was very eager to hear what he would\r\nsay to the landlady. She was evidently quite fascinated by Razumihin.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had she left the room than the sick man flung off the\r\nbedclothes and leapt out of bed like a madman. With burning, twitching\r\nimpatience he had waited for them to be gone so that he might set to\r\nwork. But to what work? Now, as though to spite him, it eluded him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood God, only tell me one thing: do they know of it yet or not? What\r\nif they know it and are only pretending, mocking me while I am laid up,\r\nand then they will come in and tell me that it\xe2\x80\x99s been discovered long\r\nago and that they have only... What am I to do now? That\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nforgotten, as though on purpose; forgotten it all at once, I remembered\r\na minute ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stood in the middle of the room and gazed in miserable bewilderment\r\nabout him; he walked to the door, opened it, listened; but that was not\r\nwhat he wanted. Suddenly, as though recalling something, he rushed to\r\nthe corner where there was a hole under the paper, began examining it,\r\nput his hand into the hole, fumbled--but that was not it. He went to the\r\nstove, opened it and began rummaging in the ashes; the frayed edges of\r\nhis trousers and the rags cut off his pocket were lying there just as\r\nhe had thrown them. No one had looked, then! Then he remembered the sock\r\nabout which Razumihin had just been telling him. Yes, there it lay on\r\nthe sofa under the quilt, but it was so covered with dust and grime that\r\nZametov could not have seen anything on it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBah, Zametov! The police office! And why am I sent for to the police\r\noffice? Where\xe2\x80\x99s the notice? Bah! I am mixing it up; that was then. I\r\nlooked at my sock then, too, but now... now I have been ill. But\r\nwhat did Zametov come for? Why did Razumihin bring him?\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered,\r\nhelplessly sitting on the sofa again. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat does it mean? Am I still in\r\ndelirium, or is it real? I believe it is real.... Ah, I remember; I must\r\nescape! Make haste to escape. Yes, I must, I must escape! Yes... but\r\nwhere? And where are my clothes? I\xe2\x80\x99ve no boots. They\xe2\x80\x99ve taken them away!\r\nThey\xe2\x80\x99ve hidden them! I understand! Ah, here is my coat--they passed that\r\nover! And here is money on the table, thank God! And here\xe2\x80\x99s the I O U...\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll take the money and go and take another lodging. They won\xe2\x80\x99t find\r\nme!... Yes, but the address bureau? They\xe2\x80\x99ll find me, Razumihin will find\r\nme. Better escape altogether... far away... to America, and let them\r\ndo their worst! And take the I O U... it would be of use there.... What\r\nelse shall I take? They think I am ill! They don\xe2\x80\x99t know that I can walk,\r\nha-ha-ha! I could see by their eyes that they know all about it! If\r\nonly I could get downstairs! And what if they have set a watch\r\nthere--policemen! What\xe2\x80\x99s this tea? Ah, and here is beer left, half a\r\nbottle, cold!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe snatched up the bottle, which still contained a glassful of beer, and\r\ngulped it down with relish, as though quenching a flame in his breast.\r\nBut in another minute the beer had gone to his head, and a faint and\r\neven pleasant shiver ran down his spine. He lay down and pulled the\r\nquilt over him. His sick and incoherent thoughts grew more and more\r\ndisconnected, and soon a light, pleasant drowsiness came upon him. With\r\na sense of comfort he nestled his head into the pillow, wrapped more\r\nclosely about him the soft, wadded quilt which had replaced the old,\r\nragged greatcoat, sighed softly and sank into a deep, sound, refreshing\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\nHe woke up, hearing someone come in. He opened his eyes and saw\r\nRazumihin standing in the doorway, uncertain whether to come in or\r\nnot. Raskolnikov sat up quickly on the sofa and gazed at him, as though\r\ntrying to recall something.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you are not asleep! Here I am! Nastasya, bring in the parcel!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Razumihin shouted down the stairs. \xe2\x80\x9cYou shall have the account\r\ndirectly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat time is it?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Raskolnikov, looking round uneasily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you had a fine sleep, brother, it\xe2\x80\x99s almost evening, it will be six\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock directly. You have slept more than six hours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood heavens! Have I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd why not? It will do you good. What\xe2\x80\x99s the hurry? A tryst, is it?\r\nWe\xe2\x80\x99ve all time before us. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been waiting for the last three hours for\r\nyou; I\xe2\x80\x99ve been up twice and found you asleep. I\xe2\x80\x99ve called on Zossimov\r\ntwice; not at home, only fancy! But no matter, he will turn up. And\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve been out on my own business, too. You know I\xe2\x80\x99ve been moving to-day,\r\nmoving with my uncle. I have an uncle living with me now. But that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nno matter, to business. Give me the parcel, Nastasya. We will open it\r\ndirectly. And how do you feel now, brother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am quite well, I am not ill. Razumihin, have you been here long?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you I\xe2\x80\x99ve been waiting for the last three hours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow long have you been coming here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy I told you all about it this morning. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you remember?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRaskolnikov pondered. The morning seemed like a dream to him. He could\r\nnot remember alone, and looked inquiringly at Razumihin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHm!\xe2\x80\x9d said the latter, \xe2\x80\x9che has forgotten. I fancied then that you were\r\nnot quite yourself. Now you are better for your sleep.... You really\r\nlook much better. First-rate! Well, to business. Look here, my dear\r\nboy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe began untying the bundle, which evidently interested him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBelieve me, brother, this is something specially near my heart. For we\r\nmust make a man of you. Let\xe2\x80\x99s begin from the top. Do you see this\r\ncap?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, taking out of the bundle a fairly good though cheap and\r\nordinary cap. \xe2\x80\x9cLet me try it on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPresently, afterwards,\xe2\x80\x9d said Raskolnikov, waving it off pettishly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, Rodya, my boy, don\xe2\x80\x99t oppose it, afterwards will be too late; and\r\nI shan\xe2\x80\x99t sleep all night, for I bought it by guess, without measure.\r\nJust right!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried triumphantly, fitting it on, \xe2\x80\x9cjust your size! A\r\nproper head-covering is the first thing in dress and a recommendation in\r\nits own way. Tolstyakov, a friend of mine, is always obliged to take off\r\nhis pudding basin when he goes into any public place where other\r\npeople wear their hats or caps. People think he does it from slavish\r\npoliteness, but it\xe2\x80\x99s simply because he is ashamed of his bird\xe2\x80\x99s nest;\r\nhe is such a boastful fellow! Look, Nastasya, here are two specimens of\r\nheadgear: this Palmerston\xe2\x80\x9d--he took from the corner Raskolnikov\xe2\x80\x99s old,\r\nbattered hat, which for some unknown reason, he called a Palmerston--\xe2\x80\x9cor\r\nthis jewel! Guess the price, Rodya, what do you suppose I paid for it,\r\nNastasya!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, turning to her, seeing that Raskolnikov did not\r\nspeak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwenty copecks, no more, I dare say,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Nastasya.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwenty copecks, silly!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, offended. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, nowadays you would\r\ncost more than that--eighty copecks! And that only because it has been\r\nworn. And it\xe2\x80\x99s bought on condition that when\xe2\x80\x99s it\xe2\x80\x99s worn out, they will\r\ngive you another next year. Yes, on my word! Well, now let us pass to\r\nthe United States of America, as they called them at school. I assure\r\nyou I am proud of these breeches,\xe2\x80\x9d and he exhibited to Raskolnikov a\r\npair of light, summer trousers of grey woollen material. \xe2\x80\x9cNo holes, no\r\nspots, and quite respectable, although a little worn; and a waistcoat\r\nto match, quite in the fashion. And its being worn really is an\r\nimprovement, it\xe2\x80\x99s softer, smoother.... You see, Rodya, to my thinking,\r\nthe great thing for getting on in the world is always to keep to the\r\nseasons; if you don\xe2\x80\x99t insist on having asparagus in January, you keep\r\nyour money in your purse; and it\xe2\x80\x99s the same with this purchase. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsummer now, so I\xe2\x80\x99ve been buying summer things--warmer materials will be\r\nwanted for autumn, so you will have to throw these away in any case...\r\nespecially as they will be done for by then from their own lack of\r\ncoherence if not your higher standard of luxury. Come, price them! What\r\ndo you say? Two roubles twenty-five copecks! And remember the condition:\r\nif you wear these out, you will have another suit for nothing! They only\r\ndo business on that system at Fedyaev\xe2\x80\x99s; if you\xe2\x80\x99ve bought a thing once,\r\nyou are satisfied for life, for you will never go there again of your\r\nown free will. Now for the boots. What do you say? You see that they are\r\na bit worn, but they\xe2\x80\x99ll last a couple of months, for it\xe2\x80\x99s foreign work\r\nand foreign leather; the secretary of the English Embassy sold them last\r\nweek--he had only worn them six days, but he was very short of cash.\r\nPrice--a rouble and a half. A bargain?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut perhaps they won\xe2\x80\x99t fit,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Nastasya.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot fit? Just look!\xe2\x80\x9d and he pulled out of his pocket Raskolnikov\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nold, broken boot, stiffly coated with dry mud. \xe2\x80\x9cI did not go\r\nempty-handed--they took the size from this monster. We all did our best.\r\nAnd as to your linen, your landlady has seen to that. Here, to begin\r\nwith are three shirts, hempen but with a fashionable front.... Well\r\nnow then, eighty copecks the cap, two roubles twenty-five copecks the\r\nsuit--together three roubles five copecks--a rouble and a half for the\r\nboots--for, you see, they are very good--and that makes four roubles\r\nfifty-five copecks; five roubles for the underclothes--they were\r\nbought in the lot--which makes exactly nine roubles fifty-five copecks.\r\nForty-five copecks change in coppers. Will you take it? And so, Rodya,\r\nyou are set up with a complete new rig-out, for your overcoat will\r\nserve, and even has a style of its own. That comes from getting one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nclothes from Sharmer\xe2\x80\x99s! As for your socks and other things, I leave them\r\nto you; we\xe2\x80\x99ve twenty-five roubles left. And as for Pashenka and paying\r\nfor your lodging, don\xe2\x80\x99t you worry. I tell you she\xe2\x80\x99ll trust you for\r\nanything. And now, brother, let me change your linen, for I daresay you\r\nwill throw off your illness with your shirt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me be! I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to!\xe2\x80\x9d Raskolnikov waved him off. He had listened\r\nwith disgust to Razumihin\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to be playful about his purchases.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, brother, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell me I\xe2\x80\x99ve been trudging around for nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Razumihin insisted. \xe2\x80\x9cNastasya, don\xe2\x80\x99t be bashful, but help me--that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nit,\xe2\x80\x9d and in spite of Raskolnikov\xe2\x80\x99s resistance he changed his linen. The\r\nlatter sank back on the pillows and for a minute or two said nothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will be long before I get rid of them,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat money was\r\nall that bought with?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked at last, gazing at the wall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMoney? Why, your own, what the messenger brought from Vahrushin, your\r\nmother sent it. Have you forgotten that, too?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI remember now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Raskolnikov after a long, sullen silence.\r\nRazumihin looked at him, frowning and uneasy.\r\n\r\nThe door opened and a tall, stout man whose appearance seemed familiar\r\nto Raskolnikov came in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nZossimov was a tall, fat man with a puffy, colourless, clean-shaven face\r\nand straight flaxen hair. He wore spectacles, and a big gold ring on\r\nhis fat finger. He was twenty-seven. He had on a light grey fashionable\r\nloose coat, light summer trousers, and everything about him loose,\r\nfashionable and spick and span; his linen was irreproachable, his\r\nwatch-chain was massive. In manner he was slow and, as it were,\r\nnonchalant, and at the same time studiously free and easy; he made\r\nefforts to conceal his self-importance, but it was apparent at every\r\ninstant. All his acquaintances found him tedious, but said he was clever\r\nat his work.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been to you twice to-day, brother. You see, he\xe2\x80\x99s come to himself,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n cried Razumihin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see, I see; and how do we feel now, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d said Zossimov to\r\nRaskolnikov, watching him carefully and, sitting down at the foot of the\r\nsofa, he settled himself as comfortably as he could.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is still depressed,\xe2\x80\x9d Razumihin went on. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve just changed his\r\nlinen and he almost cried.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s very natural; you might have put it off if he did not wish\r\nit.... His pulse is first-rate. Is your head still aching, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am well, I am perfectly well!\xe2\x80\x9d Raskolnikov declared positively\r\nand irritably. He raised himself on the sofa and looked at them with\r\nglittering eyes, but sank back on to the pillow at once and turned to\r\nthe wall. Zossimov watched him intently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good.... Going on all right,\xe2\x80\x9d he said lazily. \xe2\x80\x9cHas he eaten\r\nanything?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey told him, and asked what he might have.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe may have anything... soup, tea... mushrooms and cucumbers, of\r\ncourse, you must not give him; he\xe2\x80\x99d better not have meat either, and...\r\nbut no need to tell you that!\xe2\x80\x9d Razumihin and he looked at each\r\nother. \xe2\x80\x9cNo more medicine or anything. I\xe2\x80\x99ll look at him again to-morrow.\r\nPerhaps, to-day even... but never mind...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow evening I shall take him for a walk,\xe2\x80\x9d said Razumihin. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are\r\ngoing to the Yusupov garden and then to the Palais de Cristal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would not disturb him to-morrow at all, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know... a little,\r\nmaybe... but we\xe2\x80\x99ll see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAch, what a nuisance! I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a house-warming party to-night; it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nonly a step from here. Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t he come? He could lie on the sofa. You\r\nare coming?\xe2\x80\x9d Razumihin said to Zossimov. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t forget, you promised.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, only rather later. What are you going to do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, nothing--tea, vodka, herrings. There will be a pie... just our\r\nfriends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd who?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll neighbours here, almost all new friends, except my old uncle, and\r\nhe is new too--he only arrived in Petersburg yesterday to see to some\r\nbusiness of his. We meet once in five years.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s been stagnating all his life as a district postmaster; gets a\r\nlittle pension. He is sixty-five--not worth talking about.... But I\r\nam fond of him. Porfiry Petrovitch, the head of the Investigation\r\nDepartment here... But you know him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he a relation of yours, too?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA very distant one. But why are you scowling? Because you quarrelled\r\nonce, won\xe2\x80\x99t you come then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care a damn for him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo much the better. Well, there will be some students, a teacher, a\r\ngovernment clerk, a musician, an officer and Zametov.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo tell me, please, what you or he\xe2\x80\x9d--Zossimov nodded at\r\nRaskolnikov--\xe2\x80\x9ccan have in common with this Zametov?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you particular gentleman! Principles! You are worked by principles,\r\nas it were by springs; you won\xe2\x80\x99t venture to turn round on your own\r\naccount. If a man is a nice fellow, that\xe2\x80\x99s the only principle I go upon.\r\nZametov is a delightful person.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThough he does take bribes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, he does! and what of it? I don\xe2\x80\x99t care if he does take bribes,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Razumihin cried with unnatural irritability. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t praise him for\r\ntaking bribes. I only say he is a nice man in his own way! But if one\r\nlooks at men in all ways--are there many good ones left? Why, I am sure\r\nI shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be worth a baked onion myself... perhaps with you thrown\r\nin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s too little; I\xe2\x80\x99d give two for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t give more than one for you. No more of your jokes!\r\nZametov is no more than a boy. I can pull his hair and one must draw him\r\nnot repel him. You\xe2\x80\x99ll never improve a man by repelling him, especially\r\na boy. One has to be twice as careful with a boy. Oh, you progressive\r\ndullards! You don\xe2\x80\x99t understand. You harm yourselves running another man\r\ndown.... But if you want to know, we really have something in common.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should like to know what.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, it\xe2\x80\x99s all about a house-painter.... We are getting him out of\r\na mess! Though indeed there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to fear now. The matter is\r\nabsolutely self-evident. We only put on steam.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA painter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, haven\xe2\x80\x99t I told you about it? I only told you the beginning then\r\nabout the murder of the old pawnbroker-woman. Well, the painter is mixed\r\nup in it...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I heard about that murder before and was rather interested in it...\r\npartly... for one reason.... I read about it in the papers, too....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLizaveta was murdered, too,\xe2\x80\x9d Nastasya blurted out, suddenly addressing\r\nRaskolnikov. She remained in the room all the time, standing by the door\r\nlistening.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLizaveta,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Raskolnikov hardly audibly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLizaveta, who sold old clothes. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t you know her? She used to come\r\nhere. She mended a shirt for you, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRaskolnikov turned to the wall where in the dirty, yellow paper he\r\npicked out one clumsy, white flower with brown lines on it and began\r\nexamining how many petals there were in it, how many scallops in the\r\npetals and how many lines on them. He felt his arms and legs as lifeless\r\nas though they had been cut off. He did not attempt to move, but stared\r\nobstinately at the flower.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what about the painter?\xe2\x80\x9d Zossimov interrupted Nastasya\xe2\x80\x99s chatter\r\nwith marked displeasure. She sighed and was silent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, he was accused of the murder,\xe2\x80\x9d Razumihin went on hotly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas there evidence against him then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvidence, indeed! Evidence that was no evidence, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\r\nhave to prove. It was just as they pitched on those fellows, Koch and\r\nPestryakov, at first. Foo! how stupidly it\xe2\x80\x99s all done, it makes one\r\nsick, though it\xe2\x80\x99s not one\xe2\x80\x99s business! Pestryakov may be coming\r\nto-night.... By the way, Rodya, you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard about the business already;\r\nit happened before you were ill, the day before you fainted at the\r\npolice office while they were talking about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nZossimov looked curiously at Raskolnikov. He did not stir.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I say, Razumihin, I wonder at you. What a busybody you are!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Zossimov observed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaybe I am, but we will get him off anyway,\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Razumihin,\r\nbringing his fist down on the table. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the most offensive is not\r\ntheir lying--one can always forgive lying--lying is a delightful thing,\r\nfor it leads to truth--what is offensive is that they lie and worship\r\ntheir own lying.... I respect Porfiry, but... What threw them out at\r\nfirst? The door was locked, and when they came back with the porter\r\nit was open. So it followed that Koch and Pestryakov were the\r\nmurderers--that was their logic!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut don\xe2\x80\x99t excite yourself; they simply detained them, they could not\r\nhelp that.... And, by the way, I\xe2\x80\x99ve met that man Koch. He used to buy\r\nunredeemed pledges from the old woman? Eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, he is a swindler. He buys up bad debts, too. He makes a profession\r\nof it. But enough of him! Do you know what makes me angry? It\xe2\x80\x99s their\r\nsickening rotten, petrified routine.... And this case might be the means\r\nof introducing a new method. One can show from the psychological data\r\nalone how to get on the track of the real man. \xe2\x80\x98We have facts,\xe2\x80\x99 they\r\nsay. But facts are not everything--at least half the business lies in\r\nhow you interpret them!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you interpret them, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnyway, one can\xe2\x80\x99t hold one\xe2\x80\x99s tongue when one has a feeling, a tangible\r\nfeeling, that one might be a help if only.... Eh! Do you know the\r\ndetails of the case?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am waiting to hear about the painter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes! Well, here\xe2\x80\x99s the story. Early on the third day after the\r\nmurder, when they were still dandling Koch and Pestryakov--though they\r\naccounted for every step they took and it was as plain as a pikestaff--an\r\nunexpected fact turned up. A peasant called Dushkin, who keeps a\r\ndram-shop facing the house, brought to the police office a jeweller\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncase containing some gold ear-rings, and told a long rigamarole. \xe2\x80\x98The\r\nday before yesterday, just after eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock\xe2\x80\x99--mark the day and the\r\nhour!--\xe2\x80\x98a journeyman house-painter, Nikolay, who had been in to see me\r\nalready that day, brought me this box of gold ear-rings and stones, and\r\nasked me to give him two roubles for them. When I asked him where he got\r\nthem, he said that he picked them up in the street. I did not ask him\r\nanything more.\xe2\x80\x99 I am telling you Dushkin\xe2\x80\x99s story. \xe2\x80\x98I gave him a note\xe2\x80\x99--a\r\nrouble that is--\xe2\x80\x98for I thought if he did not pawn it with me he would\r\nwith another. It would all come to the same thing--he\xe2\x80\x99d spend it on\r\ndrink, so the thing had better be with me. The further you hide it\r\nthe quicker you will find it, and if anything turns up, if I hear any\r\nrumours, I\xe2\x80\x99ll take it to the police.\xe2\x80\x99 Of course, that\xe2\x80\x99s all taradiddle;\r\nhe lies like a horse, for I know this Dushkin, he is a pawnbroker and\r\na receiver of stolen goods, and he did not cheat Nikolay out of a\r\nthirty-rouble trinket in order to give it to the police. He was simply\r\nafraid. But no matter, to return to Dushkin\xe2\x80\x99s story. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve known\r\nthis peasant, Nikolay Dementyev, from a child; he comes from the same\r\nprovince and district of Zara\xc3\xafsk, we are both Ryazan men. And though\r\nNikolay is not a drunkard, he drinks, and I knew he had a job in that\r\nhouse, painting work with Dmitri, who comes from the same village, too.\r\nAs soon as he got the rouble he changed it, had a couple of glasses,\r\ntook his change and went out. But I did not see Dmitri with him then.\r\nAnd the next day I heard that someone had murdered Alyona Ivanovna and\r\nher sister, Lizaveta Ivanovna, with an axe. I knew them, and I felt\r\nsuspicious about the ear-rings at once, for I knew the murdered woman\r\nlent money on pledges. I went to the house, and began to make careful\r\ninquiries without saying a word to anyone. First of all I asked, \xe2\x80\x9cIs\r\nNikolay here?\xe2\x80\x9d Dmitri told me that Nikolay had gone off on the spree; he\r\nhad come home at daybreak drunk, stayed in the house about ten minutes,\r\nand went out again. Dmitri didn\xe2\x80\x99t see him again and is finishing the\r\njob alone. And their job is on the same staircase as the murder, on\r\nthe second floor. When I heard all that I did not say a word to\r\nanyone\xe2\x80\x99--that\xe2\x80\x99s Dushkin\xe2\x80\x99s tale--\xe2\x80\x98but I found out what I could about\r\nthe murder, and went home feeling as suspicious as ever. And at eight\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock this morning\xe2\x80\x99--that was the third day, you understand--\xe2\x80\x98I saw\r\nNikolay coming in, not sober, though not to say very drunk--he could\r\nunderstand what was said to him. He sat down on the bench and did not\r\nspeak. There was only one stranger in the bar and a man I knew asleep\r\non a bench and our two boys. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you seen Dmitri?\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I\r\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you\xe2\x80\x99ve not been here either?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cNot since the day\r\nbefore yesterday,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd where did you sleep last night?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n \xe2\x80\x9cIn Peski, with the Kolomensky men.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAnd where did you get those\r\near-rings?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked. \xe2\x80\x9cI found them in the street,\xe2\x80\x9d and the way he said\r\nit was a bit queer; he did not look at me. \xe2\x80\x9cDid you hear what happened\r\nthat very evening, at that very hour, on that same staircase?\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cI had not heard,\xe2\x80\x9d and all the while he was listening,\r\nhis eyes were staring out of his head and he turned as white as chalk. I\r\ntold him all about it and he took his hat and began getting up. I wanted\r\nto keep him. \xe2\x80\x9cWait a bit, Nikolay,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cwon\xe2\x80\x99t you have a drink?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n And I signed to the boy to hold the door, and I came out from behind the\r\nbar; but he darted out and down the street to the turning at a run.\r\nI have not seen him since. Then my doubts were at an end--it was his\r\ndoing, as clear as could be....\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should think so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Zossimov.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait! Hear the end. Of course they sought high and low for Nikolay;\r\nthey detained Dushkin and searched his house; Dmitri, too, was arrested;\r\nthe Kolomensky men also were turned inside out. And the day before\r\nyesterday they arrested Nikolay in a tavern at the end of the town. He\r\nhad gone there, taken the silver cross off his neck and asked for a dram\r\nfor it. They gave it to him. A few minutes afterwards the woman went\r\nto the cowshed, and through a crack in the wall she saw in the stable\r\nadjoining he had made a noose of his sash from the beam, stood on a\r\nblock of wood, and was trying to put his neck in the noose. The woman\r\nscreeched her hardest; people ran in. \xe2\x80\x98So that\xe2\x80\x99s what you are up to!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Take me,\xe2\x80\x99 he says, \xe2\x80\x98to such-and-such a police officer; I\xe2\x80\x99ll confess\r\neverything.\xe2\x80\x99 Well, they took him to that police station--that is\r\nhere--with a suitable escort. So they asked him this and that, how old\r\nhe is, \xe2\x80\x98twenty-two,\xe2\x80\x99 and so on. At the question, \xe2\x80\x98When you were working\r\nwith Dmitri, didn\xe2\x80\x99t you see anyone on the staircase at such-and-such a\r\ntime?\xe2\x80\x99--answer: \xe2\x80\x98To be sure folks may have gone up and down, but I did\r\nnot notice them.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98And didn\xe2\x80\x99t you hear anything, any noise, and so on?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We heard nothing special.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98And did you hear, Nikolay, that on the same\r\nday Widow So-and-so and her sister were murdered and robbed?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nnever knew a thing about it. The first I heard of it was from Afanasy\r\nPavlovitch the day before yesterday.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98And where did you find the\r\near-rings?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98I found them on the pavement.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you go to work\r\nwith Dmitri the other day?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Because I was drinking.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98And where were\r\nyou drinking?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Oh, in such-and-such a place.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Why did you run away\r\nfrom Dushkin\xe2\x80\x99s?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Because I was awfully frightened.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98What were\r\nyou frightened of?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98That I should be accused.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98How could you be\r\nfrightened, if you felt free from guilt?\xe2\x80\x99 Now, Zossimov, you may not\r\nbelieve me, that question was put literally in those words. I know it\r\nfor a fact, it was repeated to me exactly! What do you say to that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, anyway, there\xe2\x80\x99s the evidence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not talking of the evidence now, I am talking about that question,\r\nof their own idea of themselves. Well, so they squeezed and squeezed\r\nhim and he confessed: \xe2\x80\x98I did not find it in the street, but in the flat\r\nwhere I was painting with Dmitri.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98And how was that?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Why, Dmitri and\r\nI were painting there all day, and we were just getting ready to go, and\r\nDmitri took a brush and painted my face, and he ran off and I after him.\r\nI ran after him, shouting my hardest, and at the bottom of the stairs I\r\nran right against the porter and some gentlemen--and how many gentlemen\r\nwere there I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember. And the porter swore at me, and the other\r\nporter swore, too, and the porter\xe2\x80\x99s wife came out, and swore at us, too;\r\nand a gentleman came into the entry with a lady, and he swore at us,\r\ntoo, for Dmitri and I lay right across the way. I got hold of Dmitri\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhair and knocked him down and began beating him. And Dmitri, too, caught\r\nme by the hair and began beating me. But we did it all not for temper\r\nbut in a friendly way, for sport. And then Dmitri escaped and ran into\r\nthe street, and I ran after him; but I did not catch him, and went back\r\nto the flat alone; I had to clear up my things. I began putting them\r\ntogether, expecting Dmitri to come, and there in the passage, in the\r\ncorner by the door, I stepped on the box. I saw it lying there wrapped\r\nup in paper. I took off the paper, saw some little hooks, undid them,\r\nand in the box were the ear-rings....\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBehind the door? Lying behind the door? Behind the door?\xe2\x80\x9d Raskolnikov\r\ncried suddenly, staring with a blank look of terror at Razumihin, and he\r\nslowly sat up on the sofa, leaning on his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes... why? What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter? What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong?\xe2\x80\x9d Razumihin, too, got up\r\nfrom his seat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing,\xe2\x80\x9d Raskolnikov answered faintly, turning to the wall. All were\r\nsilent for a while.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe must have waked from a dream,\xe2\x80\x9d Razumihin said at last, looking\r\ninquiringly at Zossimov. The latter slightly shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, go on,\xe2\x80\x9d said Zossimov. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat next?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat next? As soon as he saw the ear-rings, forgetting Dmitri and\r\neverything, he took up his cap and ran to Dushkin and, as we know, got\r\na rouble from him. He told a lie saying he found them in the street, and\r\nwent off drinking. He keeps repeating his old story about the murder:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I know nothing of it, never heard of it till the day before yesterday.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you come to the police till now?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98I was frightened.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And why did you try to hang yourself?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98From anxiety.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98What anxiety?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That I should be accused of it.\xe2\x80\x99 Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s the whole story. And now\r\nwhat do you suppose they deduced from that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, there\xe2\x80\x99s no supposing. There\xe2\x80\x99s a clue, such as it is, a fact. You\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have your painter set free?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow they\xe2\x80\x99ve simply taken him for the murderer. They haven\xe2\x80\x99t a shadow of\r\ndoubt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s nonsense. You are excited. But what about the ear-rings? You\r\nmust admit that, if on the very same day and hour ear-rings from the old\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s box have come into Nikolay\xe2\x80\x99s hands, they must have come there\r\nsomehow. That\xe2\x80\x99s a good deal in such a case.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow did they get there? How did they get there?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Razumihin.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can you, a doctor, whose duty it is to study man and who has more\r\nopportunity than anyone else for studying human nature--how can you fail\r\nto see the character of the man in the whole story? Don\xe2\x80\x99t you see at\r\nonce that the answers he has given in the examination are the holy\r\ntruth? They came into his hand precisely as he has told us--he stepped\r\non the box and picked it up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe holy truth! But didn\xe2\x80\x99t he own himself that he told a lie at first?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen to me, listen attentively. The porter and Koch and Pestryakov\r\nand the other porter and the wife of the first porter and the woman who\r\nwas sitting in the porter\xe2\x80\x99s lodge and the man Kryukov, who had just got\r\nout of a cab at that minute and went in at the entry with a lady on his\r\narm, that is eight or ten witnesses, agree that Nikolay had Dmitri on\r\nthe ground, was lying on him beating him, while Dmitri hung on to his\r\nhair, beating him, too. They lay right across the way, blocking the\r\nthoroughfare. They were sworn at on all sides while they \xe2\x80\x98like children\xe2\x80\x99\r\n(the very words of the witnesses) were falling over one another,\r\nsquealing, fighting and laughing with the funniest faces, and, chasing\r\none another like children, they ran into the street. Now take careful\r\nnote. The bodies upstairs were warm, you understand, warm when they\r\nfound them! If they, or Nikolay alone, had murdered them and broken open\r\nthe boxes, or simply taken part in the robbery, allow me to ask you one\r\nquestion: do their state of mind, their squeals and giggles and childish\r\nscuffling at the gate fit in with axes, bloodshed, fiendish cunning,\r\nrobbery? They\xe2\x80\x99d just killed them, not five or ten minutes before, for\r\nthe bodies were still warm, and at once, leaving the flat open, knowing\r\nthat people would go there at once, flinging away their booty, they\r\nrolled about like children, laughing and attracting general attention.\r\nAnd there are a dozen witnesses to swear to that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course it is strange! It\xe2\x80\x99s impossible, indeed, but...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, brother, no _buts_. And if the ear-rings being found in Nikolay\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhands at the very day and hour of the murder constitutes an important\r\npiece of circumstantial evidence against him--although the explanation\r\ngiven by him accounts for it, and therefore it does not tell seriously\r\nagainst him--one must take into consideration the facts which prove him\r\ninnocent, especially as they are facts that _cannot be denied_. And\r\ndo you suppose, from the character of our legal system, that they will\r\naccept, or that they are in a position to accept, this fact--resting\r\nsimply on a psychological impossibility--as irrefutable and conclusively\r\nbreaking down the circumstantial evidence for the prosecution? No, they\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t accept it, they certainly won\xe2\x80\x99t, because they found the jewel-case\r\nand the man tried to hang himself, \xe2\x80\x98which he could not have done if he\r\nhadn\xe2\x80\x99t felt guilty.\xe2\x80\x99 That\xe2\x80\x99s the point, that\xe2\x80\x99s what excites me, you must\r\nunderstand!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I see you are excited! Wait a bit. I forgot to ask you; what proof\r\nis there that the box came from the old woman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s been proved,\xe2\x80\x9d said Razumihin with apparent reluctance, frowning.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKoch recognised the jewel-case and gave the name of the owner, who\r\nproved conclusively that it was his.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s bad. Now another point. Did anyone see Nikolay at the time\r\nthat Koch and Pestryakov were going upstairs at first, and is there no\r\nevidence about that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody did see him,\xe2\x80\x9d Razumihin answered with vexation. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nworst of it. Even Koch and Pestryakov did not notice them on their way\r\nupstairs, though, indeed, their evidence could not have been worth much.\r\nThey said they saw the flat was open, and that there must be work going\r\non in it, but they took no special notice and could not remember whether\r\nthere actually were men at work in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHm!... So the only evidence for the defence is that they were beating\r\none another and laughing. That constitutes a strong presumption, but...\r\nHow do you explain the facts yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do I explain them? What is there to explain? It\xe2\x80\x99s clear. At any\r\nrate, the direction in which explanation is to be sought is clear, and\r\nthe jewel-case points to it. The real murderer dropped those ear-rings.\r\nThe murderer was upstairs, locked in, when Koch and Pestryakov knocked\r\nat the door. Koch, like an ass, did not stay at the door; so the\r\nmurderer popped out and ran down, too; for he had no other way of\r\nescape. He hid from Koch, Pestryakov and the porter in the flat when\r\nNikolay and Dmitri had just run out of it. He stopped there while the\r\nporter and others were going upstairs, waited till they were out of\r\nhearing, and then went calmly downstairs at the very minute when Dmitri\r\nand Nikolay ran out into the street and there was no one in the entry;\r\npossibly he was seen, but not noticed. There are lots of people going\r\nin and out. He must have dropped the ear-rings out of his pocket when\r\nhe stood behind the door, and did not notice he dropped them, because he\r\nhad other things to think of. The jewel-case is a conclusive proof that\r\nhe did stand there.... That\xe2\x80\x99s how I explain it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToo clever! No, my boy, you\xe2\x80\x99re too clever. That beats everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, why, why?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, because everything fits too well... it\xe2\x80\x99s too melodramatic.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA-ach!\xe2\x80\x9d Razumihin was exclaiming, but at that moment the door opened\r\nand a personage came in who was a stranger to all present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nThis was a gentleman no longer young, of a stiff and portly appearance,\r\nand a cautious and sour countenance. He began by stopping short in the\r\ndoorway, staring about him with offensive and undisguised astonishment,\r\nas though asking himself what sort of place he had come to.\r\nMistrustfully and with an affectation of being alarmed and almost\r\naffronted, he scanned Raskolnikov\xe2\x80\x99s low and narrow \xe2\x80\x9ccabin.\xe2\x80\x9d With the\r\nsame amazement he stared at Raskolnikov, who lay undressed, dishevelled,\r\nunwashed, on his miserable dirty sofa, looking fixedly at him. Then with\r\nthe same deliberation he scrutinised the uncouth, unkempt figure and\r\nunshaven face of Razumihin, who looked him boldly and inquiringly in the\r\nface without rising from his seat. A constrained silence lasted for a\r\ncouple of minutes, and then, as might be expected, some scene-shifting\r\ntook place. Reflecting, probably from certain fairly unmistakable signs,\r\nthat he would get nothing in this \xe2\x80\x9ccabin\xe2\x80\x9d by attempting to overawe them,\r\nthe gentleman softened somewhat, and civilly, though with some severity,\r\nemphasising every syllable of his question, addressed Zossimov:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRodion Romanovitch Raskolnikov, a student, or formerly a student?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nZossimov made a slight movement, and would have answered, had not\r\nRazumihin anticipated him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere he is lying on the sofa! What do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis familiar \xe2\x80\x9cwhat do you want\xe2\x80\x9d seemed to cut the ground from the\r\nfeet of the pompous gentleman. He was turning to Razumihin, but checked\r\nhimself in time and turned to Zossimov again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is Raskolnikov,\xe2\x80\x9d mumbled Zossimov, nodding towards him. Then he\r\ngave a prolonged yawn, opening his mouth as wide as possible. Then he\r\nlazily put his hand into his waistcoat-pocket, pulled out a huge gold\r\nwatch in a round hunter\xe2\x80\x99s case, opened it, looked at it and as slowly\r\nand lazily proceeded to put it back.\r\n\r\nRaskolnikov himself lay without speaking, on his back, gazing\r\npersistently, though without understanding, at the stranger. Now that\r\nhis face was turned away from the strange flower on the paper, it\r\nwas extremely pale and wore a look of anguish, as though he had just\r\nundergone an agonising operation or just been taken from the rack. But\r\nthe new-comer gradually began to arouse his attention, then his wonder,\r\nthen suspicion and even alarm. When Zossimov said \xe2\x80\x9cThis is Raskolnikov\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he jumped up quickly, sat on the sofa and with an almost defiant, but\r\nweak and breaking, voice articulated:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I am Raskolnikov! What do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe visitor scrutinised him and pronounced impressively:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPyotr Petrovitch Luzhin. I believe I have reason to hope that my name\r\nis not wholly unknown to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Raskolnikov, who had expected something quite different, gazed\r\nblankly and dreamily at him, making no reply, as though he heard the\r\nname of Pyotr Petrovitch for the first time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it possible that you can up to the present have received no\r\ninformation?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Pyotr Petrovitch, somewhat disconcerted.\r\n\r\nIn reply Raskolnikov sank languidly back on the pillow, put his hands\r\nbehind his head and gazed at the ceiling. A look of dismay came into\r\nLuzhin\xe2\x80\x99s face. Zossimov and Razumihin stared at him more inquisitively\r\nthan ever, and at last he showed unmistakable signs of embarrassment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had presumed and calculated,\xe2\x80\x9d he faltered, \xe2\x80\x9cthat a letter posted more\r\nthan ten days, if not a fortnight ago...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, why are you standing in the doorway?\xe2\x80\x9d Razumihin interrupted\r\nsuddenly. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you\xe2\x80\x99ve something to say, sit down. Nastasya and you are so\r\ncrowded. Nastasya, make room. Here\xe2\x80\x99s a chair, thread your way in!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe moved his chair back from the table, made a little space between the\r\ntable and his knees, and waited in a rather cramped position for the\r\nvisitor to \xe2\x80\x9cthread his way in.\xe2\x80\x9d The minute was so chosen that it was\r\nimpossible to refuse, and the visitor squeezed his way through, hurrying\r\nand stumbling. Reaching the chair, he sat down, looking suspiciously at\r\nRazumihin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo need to be nervous,\xe2\x80\x9d the latter blurted out. \xe2\x80\x9cRodya has been ill for\r\nthe last five days and delirious for three, but now he is recovering and\r\nhas got an appetite. This is his doctor, who has just had a look at him.\r\nI am a comrade of Rodya\xe2\x80\x99s, like him, formerly a student, and now I am\r\nnursing him; so don\xe2\x80\x99t you take any notice of us, but go on with your\r\nbusiness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you. But shall I not disturb the invalid by my presence and\r\nconversation?\xe2\x80\x9d Pyotr Petrovitch asked of Zossimov.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cN-no,\xe2\x80\x9d mumbled Zossimov; \xe2\x80\x9cyou may amuse him.\xe2\x80\x9d He yawned again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has been conscious a long time, since the morning,\xe2\x80\x9d went on\r\nRazumihin, whose familiarity seemed so much like unaffected good-nature\r\nthat Pyotr Petrovitch began to be more cheerful, partly, perhaps,\r\nbecause this shabby and impudent person had introduced himself as a\r\nstudent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour mamma,\xe2\x80\x9d began Luzhin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHm!\xe2\x80\x9d Razumihin cleared his throat loudly. Luzhin looked at him\r\ninquiringly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all right, go on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLuzhin shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour mamma had commenced a letter to you while I was sojourning in\r\nher neighbourhood. On my arrival here I purposely allowed a few days to\r\nelapse before coming to see you, in order that I might be fully\r\nassured that you were in full possession of the tidings; but now, to my\r\nastonishment...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know, I know!\xe2\x80\x9d Raskolnikov cried suddenly with impatient vexation.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you are the _fianc\xc3\xa9_? I know, and that\xe2\x80\x99s enough!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was no doubt about Pyotr Petrovitch\xe2\x80\x99s being offended this time,\r\nbut he said nothing. He made a violent effort to understand what it all\r\nmeant. There was a moment\xe2\x80\x99s silence.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Raskolnikov, who had turned a little towards him when he\r\nanswered, began suddenly staring at him again with marked curiosity, as\r\nthough he had not had a good look at him yet, or as though something\r\nnew had struck him; he rose from his pillow on purpose to stare at\r\nhim. There certainly was something peculiar in Pyotr Petrovitch\xe2\x80\x99s whole\r\nappearance, something which seemed to justify the title of \xe2\x80\x9cfianc\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x9d so\r\nunceremoniously applied to him. In the first place, it was evident, far\r\ntoo much so indeed, that Pyotr Petrovitch had made eager use of his few\r\ndays in the capital to get himself up and rig himself out in expectation\r\nof his betrothed--a perfectly innocent and permissible proceeding,\r\nindeed. Even his own, perhaps too complacent, consciousness of the\r\nagreeable improvement in his appearance might have been forgiven in such\r\ncircumstances, seeing that Pyotr Petrovitch had taken up the r\xc3\xb4le of\r\nfianc\xc3\xa9. All his clothes were fresh from the tailor\xe2\x80\x99s and were all\r\nright, except for being too new and too distinctly appropriate. Even\r\nthe stylish new round hat had the same significance. Pyotr Petrovitch\r\ntreated it too respectfully and held it too carefully in his hands. The\r\nexquisite pair of lavender gloves, real Louvain, told the same tale,\r\nif only from the fact of his not wearing them, but carrying them in\r\nhis hand for show. Light and youthful colours predominated in Pyotr\r\nPetrovitch\xe2\x80\x99s attire. He wore a charming summer jacket of a fawn shade,\r\nlight thin trousers, a waistcoat of the same, new and fine linen, a\r\ncravat of the lightest cambric with pink stripes on it, and the best\r\nof it was, this all suited Pyotr Petrovitch. His very fresh and even\r\nhandsome face looked younger than his forty-five years at all times.\r\nHis dark, mutton-chop whiskers made an agreeable setting on both sides,\r\ngrowing thickly upon his shining, clean-shaven chin. Even his hair,\r\ntouched here and there with grey, though it had been combed and curled\r\nat a hairdresser\xe2\x80\x99s, did not give him a stupid appearance, as curled hair\r\nusually does, by inevitably suggesting a German on his wedding-day.\r\nIf there really was something unpleasing and repulsive in his rather\r\ngood-looking and imposing countenance, it was due to quite other\r\ncauses. After scanning Mr. Luzhin unceremoniously, Raskolnikov smiled\r\nmalignantly, sank back on the pillow and stared at the ceiling as\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Luzhin hardened his heart and seemed to determine to take no\r\nnotice of their oddities.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI feel the greatest regret at finding you in this situation,\xe2\x80\x9d he began,\r\nagain breaking the silence with an effort. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I had been aware of your\r\nillness I should have come earlier. But you know what business is. I\r\nhave, too, a very important legal affair in the Senate, not to mention\r\nother preoccupations which you may well conjecture. I am expecting your\r\nmamma and sister any minute.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRaskolnikov made a movement and seemed about to speak; his face showed\r\nsome excitement. Pyotr Petrovitch paused, waited, but as nothing\r\nfollowed, he went on:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c... Any minute. I have found a lodging for them on their arrival.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Raskolnikov weakly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery near here, in Bakaleyev\xe2\x80\x99s house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s in Voskresensky,\xe2\x80\x9d put in Razumihin. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are two storeys of\r\nrooms, let by a merchant called Yushin; I\xe2\x80\x99ve been there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, rooms...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA disgusting place--filthy, stinking and, what\xe2\x80\x99s more, of doubtful\r\ncharacter. Things have happened there, and there are all sorts of queer\r\npeople living there. And I went there about a scandalous business. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncheap, though...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI could not, of course, find out so much about it, for I am a stranger\r\nin Petersburg myself,\xe2\x80\x9d Pyotr Petrovitch replied huffily. \xe2\x80\x9cHowever, the\r\ntwo rooms are exceedingly clean, and as it is for so short a time...\r\nI have already taken a permanent, that is, our future flat,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\naddressing Raskolnikov, \xe2\x80\x9cand I am having it done up. And meanwhile I am\r\nmyself cramped for room in a lodging with my friend Andrey Semyonovitch\r\nLebeziatnikov, in the flat of Madame Lippevechsel; it was he who told me\r\nof Bakaleyev\xe2\x80\x99s house, too...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLebeziatnikov?\xe2\x80\x9d said Raskolnikov slowly, as if recalling something.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Andrey Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov, a clerk in the Ministry. Do you\r\nknow him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes... no,\xe2\x80\x9d Raskolnikov answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcuse me, I fancied so from your inquiry. I was once his guardian....\r\nA very nice young man and advanced. I like to meet young people: one\r\nlearns new things from them.\xe2\x80\x9d Luzhin looked round hopefully at them all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Razumihin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the most serious and essential matters,\xe2\x80\x9d Pyotr Petrovitch replied,\r\nas though delighted at the question. \xe2\x80\x9cYou see, it\xe2\x80\x99s ten years since I\r\nvisited Petersburg. All the novelties, reforms, ideas have reached us in\r\nthe provinces, but to see it all more clearly one must be in Petersburg.\r\nAnd it\xe2\x80\x99s my notion that you observe and learn most by watching the\r\nyounger generation. And I confess I am delighted...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour question is a wide one. I may be mistaken, but I fancy I find\r\nclearer views, more, so to say, criticism, more practicality...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s true,\xe2\x80\x9d Zossimov let drop.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense! There\xe2\x80\x99s no practicality.\xe2\x80\x9d Razumihin flew at him.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPracticality is a difficult thing to find; it does not drop down from\r\nheaven. And for the last two hundred years we have been divorced from\r\nall practical life. Ideas, if you like, are fermenting,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to\r\nPyotr Petrovitch, \xe2\x80\x9cand desire for good exists, though it\xe2\x80\x99s in a childish\r\nform, and honesty you may find, although there are crowds of brigands.\r\nAnyway, there\xe2\x80\x99s no practicality. Practicality goes well shod.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t agree with you,\xe2\x80\x9d Pyotr Petrovitch replied, with evident\r\nenjoyment. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course, people do get carried away and make mistakes,\r\nbut one must have indulgence; those mistakes are merely evidence of\r\nenthusiasm for the cause and of abnormal external environment. If little\r\nhas been done, the time has been but short; of means I will not speak.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s my personal view, if you care to know, that something has been\r\naccomplished already. New valuable ideas, new valuable works are\r\ncirculating in the place of our old dreamy and romantic authors.\r\nLiterature is taking a maturer form, many injurious prejudices have been\r\nrooted up and turned into ridicule.... In a word, we have cut ourselves\r\noff irrevocably from the past, and that, to my thinking, is a great\r\nthing...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s learnt it by heart to show off!\xe2\x80\x9d Raskolnikov pronounced suddenly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Pyotr Petrovitch, not catching his words; but he received\r\nno reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all true,\xe2\x80\x9d Zossimov hastened to interpose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t it so?\xe2\x80\x9d Pyotr Petrovitch went on, glancing affably at Zossimov.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must admit,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, addressing Razumihin with a shade of\r\ntriumph and superciliousness--he almost added \xe2\x80\x9cyoung man\xe2\x80\x9d--\xe2\x80\x9cthat there\r\nis an advance, or, as they say now, progress in the name of science and\r\neconomic truth...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA commonplace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, not a commonplace! Hitherto, for instance, if I were told, \xe2\x80\x98love\r\nthy neighbour,\xe2\x80\x99 what came of it?\xe2\x80\x9d Pyotr Petrovitch went on, perhaps with\r\nexcessive haste. \xe2\x80\x9cIt came to my tearing my coat in half to share with my\r\nneighbour and we both were left half naked. As a Russian proverb has\r\nit, \xe2\x80\x98Catch several hares and you won\xe2\x80\x99t catch one.\xe2\x80\x99 Science now tells\r\nus, love yourself before all men, for everything in the world rests on\r\nself-interest. You love yourself and manage your own affairs properly\r\nand your coat remains whole. Economic truth adds that the better private\r\naffairs are organised in society--the more whole coats, so to say--the\r\nfirmer are its foundations and the better is the common welfare\r\norganised too. Therefore, in acquiring wealth solely and exclusively for\r\nmyself, I am acquiring, so to speak, for all, and helping to bring to\r\npass my neighbour\xe2\x80\x99s getting a little more than a torn coat; and that not\r\nfrom private, personal liberality, but as a consequence of the general\r\nadvance. The idea is simple, but unhappily it has been a long time\r\nreaching us, being hindered by idealism and sentimentality. And yet it\r\nwould seem to want very little wit to perceive it...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcuse me, I\xe2\x80\x99ve very little wit myself,\xe2\x80\x9d Razumihin cut in sharply,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand so let us drop it. I began this discussion with an object, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ngrown so sick during the last three years of this chattering to amuse\r\noneself, of this incessant flow of commonplaces, always the same, that,\r\nby Jove, I blush even when other people talk like that. You are in a\r\nhurry, no doubt, to exhibit your acquirements; and I don\xe2\x80\x99t blame you,\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s quite pardonable. I only wanted to find out what sort of man you\r\nare, for so many unscrupulous people have got hold of the progressive\r\ncause of late and have so distorted in their own interests everything\r\nthey touched, that the whole cause has been dragged in the mire. That\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nenough!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcuse me, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Luzhin, affronted, and speaking with excessive\r\ndignity. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean to suggest so unceremoniously that I too...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my dear sir... how could I?... Come, that\xe2\x80\x99s enough,\xe2\x80\x9d Razumihin\r\nconcluded, and he turned abruptly to Zossimov to continue their previous\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\nPyotr Petrovitch had the good sense to accept the disavowal. He made up\r\nhis mind to take leave in another minute or two.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI trust our acquaintance,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, addressing Raskolnikov, \xe2\x80\x9cmay, upon\r\nyour recovery and in view of the circumstances of which you are aware,\r\nbecome closer... Above all, I hope for your return to health...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRaskolnikov did not even turn his head. Pyotr Petrovitch began getting\r\nup from his chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne of her customers must have killed her,\xe2\x80\x9d Zossimov declared\r\npositively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a doubt of it,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Razumihin. \xe2\x80\x9cPorfiry doesn\xe2\x80\x99t give his\r\nopinion, but is examining all who have left pledges with her there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExamining them?\xe2\x80\x9d Raskolnikov asked aloud.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. What then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow does he get hold of them?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Zossimov.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKoch has given the names of some of them, other names are on the\r\nwrappers of the pledges and some have come forward of themselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt must have been a cunning and practised ruffian! The boldness of it!\r\nThe coolness!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s just what it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d interposed Razumihin. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what throws\r\nyou all off the scent. But I maintain that he is not cunning, not\r\npractised, and probably this was his first crime! The supposition that\r\nit was a calculated crime and a cunning criminal doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work. Suppose\r\nhim to have been inexperienced, and it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that it was only a chance\r\nthat saved him--and chance may do anything. Why, he did not foresee\r\nobstacles, perhaps! And how did he set to work? He took jewels worth\r\nten or twenty roubles, stuffing his pockets with them, ransacked the\r\nold woman\xe2\x80\x99s trunks, her rags--and they found fifteen hundred roubles,\r\nbesides notes, in a box in the top drawer of the chest! He did not know\r\nhow to rob; he could only murder. It was his first crime, I assure you,\r\nhis first crime; he lost his head. And he got off more by luck than good\r\ncounsel!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are talking of the murder of the old pawnbroker, I believe?\xe2\x80\x9d Pyotr\r\nPetrovitch put in, addressing Zossimov. He was standing, hat and gloves\r\nin hand, but before departing he felt disposed to throw off a few more\r\nintellectual phrases. He was evidently anxious to make a favourable\r\nimpression and his vanity overcame his prudence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. You\xe2\x80\x99ve heard of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, being in the neighbourhood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know the details?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t say that; but another circumstance interests me in the\r\ncase--the whole question, so to say. Not to speak of the fact that crime\r\nhas been greatly on the increase among the lower classes during the last\r\nfive years, not to speak of the cases of robbery and arson everywhere,\r\nwhat strikes me as the strangest thing is that in the higher classes,\r\ntoo, crime is increasing proportionately. In one place one hears of a\r\nstudent\xe2\x80\x99s robbing the mail on the high road; in another place people of\r\ngood social position forge false banknotes; in Moscow of late a whole\r\ngang has been captured who used to forge lottery tickets, and one of\r\nthe ringleaders was a lecturer in universal history; then our secretary\r\nabroad was murdered from some obscure motive of gain.... And if this old\r\nwoman, the pawnbroker, has been murdered by someone of a higher class\r\nin society--for peasants don\xe2\x80\x99t pawn gold trinkets--how are we to explain\r\nthis demoralisation of the civilised part of our society?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are many economic changes,\xe2\x80\x9d put in Zossimov.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow are we to explain it?\xe2\x80\x9d Razumihin caught him up. \xe2\x80\x9cIt might be\r\nexplained by our inveterate impracticality.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat answer had your lecturer in Moscow to make to the question why he\r\nwas forging notes? \xe2\x80\x98Everybody is getting rich one way or another, so I\r\nwant to make haste to get rich too.\xe2\x80\x99 I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember the exact words,\r\nbut the upshot was that he wants money for nothing, without waiting or\r\nworking! We\xe2\x80\x99ve grown used to having everything ready-made, to walking\r\non crutches, to having our food chewed for us. Then the great hour\r\nstruck,[*] and every man showed himself in his true colours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n     [*] The emancipation of the serfs in 1861 is meant.\r\n     --TRANSLATOR\xe2\x80\x99S NOTE.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut morality? And so to speak, principles...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why do you worry about it?\xe2\x80\x9d Raskolnikov interposed suddenly. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nin accordance with your theory!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn accordance with my theory?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, carry out logically the theory you were advocating just now, and\r\nit follows that people may be killed...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpon my word!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Luzhin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, that\xe2\x80\x99s not so,\xe2\x80\x9d put in Zossimov.\r\n\r\nRaskolnikov lay with a white face and twitching upper lip, breathing\r\npainfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a measure in all things,\xe2\x80\x9d Luzhin went on superciliously.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEconomic ideas are not an incitement to murder, and one has but to\r\nsuppose...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd is it true,\xe2\x80\x9d Raskolnikov interposed once more suddenly, again in a\r\nvoice quivering with fury and delight in insulting him, \xe2\x80\x9cis it true that\r\nyou told your _fianc\xc3\xa9e_... within an hour of her acceptance, that what\r\npleased you most... was that she was a beggar... because it was better\r\nto raise a wife from poverty, so that you may have complete control over\r\nher, and reproach her with your being her benefactor?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpon my word,\xe2\x80\x9d Luzhin cried wrathfully and irritably, crimson with\r\nconfusion, \xe2\x80\x9cto distort my words in this way! Excuse me, allow me to\r\nassure you that the report which has reached you, or rather, let me say,\r\nhas been conveyed to you, has no foundation in truth, and I... suspect\r\nwho... in a word... this arrow... in a word, your mamma... She seemed\r\nto me in other things, with all her excellent qualities, of a somewhat\r\nhigh-flown and romantic way of thinking.... But I was a thousand miles\r\nfrom supposing that she would misunderstand and misrepresent things in\r\nso fanciful a way.... And indeed... indeed...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you what,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Raskolnikov, raising himself on his pillow and\r\nfixing his piercing, glittering eyes upon him, \xe2\x80\x9cI tell you what.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d Luzhin stood still, waiting with a defiant and offended face.\r\nSilence lasted for some seconds.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, if ever again... you dare to mention a single word... about my\r\nmother... I shall send you flying downstairs!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with you?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Razumihin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo that\xe2\x80\x99s how it is?\xe2\x80\x9d Luzhin turned pale and bit his lip. \xe2\x80\x9cLet me tell\r\nyou, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he began deliberately, doing his utmost to restrain himself\r\nbut breathing hard, \xe2\x80\x9cat the first moment I saw you you were ill-disposed\r\nto me, but I remained here on purpose to find out more. I could forgive\r\na great deal in a sick man and a connection, but you... never after\r\nthis...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not ill,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Raskolnikov.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo much the worse...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo to hell!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Luzhin was already leaving without finishing his speech, squeezing\r\nbetween the table and the chair; Razumihin got up this time to let him\r\npass. Without glancing at anyone, and not even nodding to Zossimov, who\r\nhad for some time been making signs to him to let the sick man alone,\r\nhe went out, lifting his hat to the level of his shoulders to avoid\r\ncrushing it as he stooped to go out of the door. And even the curve of\r\nhis spine was expressive of the horrible insult he had received.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow could you--how could you!\xe2\x80\x9d Razumihin said, shaking his head in\r\nperplexity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me alone--let me alone all of you!\xe2\x80\x9d Raskolnikov cried in a frenzy.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you ever leave off tormenting me? I am not afraid of you! I am\r\nnot afraid of anyone, anyone now! Get away from me! I want to be alone,\r\nalone, alone!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome along,\xe2\x80\x9d said Zossimov, nodding to Razumihin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut we can\xe2\x80\x99t leave him like this!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome along,\xe2\x80\x9d Zossimov repeated insistently, and he went out. Razumihin\r\nthought a minute and ran to overtake him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt might be worse not to obey him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Zossimov on the stairs. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\r\nmustn\xe2\x80\x99t be irritated.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf only he could get some favourable shock, that\xe2\x80\x99s what would do it! At\r\nfirst he was better.... You know he has got something on his mind! Some\r\nfixed idea weighing on him.... I am very much afraid so; he must have!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps it\xe2\x80\x99s that gentleman, Pyotr Petrovitch. From his conversation\r\nI gather he is going to marry his sister, and that he had received a\r\nletter about it just before his illness....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, confound the man! he may have upset the case altogether. But have\r\nyou noticed, he takes no interest in anything, he does not respond to\r\nanything except one point on which he seems excited--that\xe2\x80\x99s the murder?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d Razumihin agreed, \xe2\x80\x9cI noticed that, too. He is interested,\r\nfrightened. It gave him a shock on the day he was ill in the police\r\noffice; he fainted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me more about that this evening and I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you something\r\nafterwards. He interests me very much! In half an hour I\xe2\x80\x99ll go and see\r\nhim again.... There\xe2\x80\x99ll be no inflammation though.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThanks! And I\xe2\x80\x99ll wait with Pashenka meantime and will keep watch on him\r\nthrough Nastasya....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRaskolnikov, left alone, looked with impatience and misery at Nastasya,\r\nbut she still lingered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t you have some tea now?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLater! I am sleepy! Leave me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe turned abruptly to the wall; Nastasya went out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nBut as soon as she went out, he got up, latched the door, undid the\r\nparcel which Razumihin had brought in that evening and had tied up again\r\nand began dressing. Strange to say, he seemed immediately to have become\r\nperfectly calm; not a trace of his recent delirium nor of the panic\r\nfear that had haunted him of late. It was the first moment of a strange\r\nsudden calm. His movements were precise and definite; a firm purpose was\r\nevident in them. \xe2\x80\x9cTo-day, to-day,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered to himself. He understood\r\nthat he was still weak, but his intense spiritual concentration gave him\r\nstrength and self-confidence. He hoped, moreover, that he would not\r\nfall down in the street. When he had dressed in entirely new clothes, he\r\nlooked at the money lying on the table, and after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s thought\r\nput it in his pocket. It was twenty-five roubles. He took also all the\r\ncopper change from the ten roubles spent by Razumihin on the clothes.\r\nThen he softly unlatched the door, went out, slipped downstairs and\r\nglanced in at the open kitchen door. Nastasya was standing with her back\r\nto him, blowing up the landlady\xe2\x80\x99s samovar. She heard nothing. Who would\r\nhave dreamed of his going out, indeed? A minute later he was in the\r\nstreet.\r\n\r\nIt was nearly eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock, the sun was setting. It was as stifling as\r\nbefore, but he eagerly drank in the stinking, dusty town air. His head\r\nfelt rather dizzy; a sort of savage energy gleamed suddenly in his\r\nfeverish eyes and his wasted, pale and yellow face. He did not know and\r\ndid not think where he was going, he had one thought only: \xe2\x80\x9cthat all\r\n_this_ must be ended to-day, once for all, immediately; that he would\r\nnot return home without it, because he _would not go on living like\r\nthat_.\xe2\x80\x9d How, with what to make an end? He had not an idea about it,\r\nhe did not even want to think of it. He drove away thought; thought\r\ntortured him. All he knew, all he felt was that everything must be\r\nchanged \xe2\x80\x9cone way or another,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated with desperate and immovable\r\nself-confidence and determination.\r\n\r\nFrom old habit he took his usual walk in the direction of the Hay\r\nMarket. A dark-haired young man with a barrel organ was standing in\r\nthe road in front of a little general shop and was grinding out a very\r\nsentimental song. He was accompanying a girl of fifteen, who stood\r\non the pavement in front of him. She was dressed up in a crinoline, a\r\nmantle and a straw hat with a flame-coloured feather in it, all very\r\nold and shabby. In a strong and rather agreeable voice, cracked and\r\ncoarsened by street singing, she sang in hope of getting a copper from\r\nthe shop. Raskolnikov joined two or three listeners, took out a five\r\ncopeck piece and put it in the girl\xe2\x80\x99s hand. She broke off abruptly on a\r\nsentimental high note, shouted sharply to the organ grinder \xe2\x80\x9cCome on,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n and both moved on to the next shop.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you like street music?\xe2\x80\x9d said Raskolnikov, addressing a middle-aged\r\nman standing idly by him. The man looked at him, startled and wondering.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI love to hear singing to a street organ,\xe2\x80\x9d said Raskolnikov, and his\r\nmanner seemed strangely out of keeping with the subject--\xe2\x80\x9cI like it\r\non cold, dark, damp autumn evenings--they must be damp--when all the\r\npassers-by have pale green, sickly faces, or better still when wet\r\nsnow is falling straight down, when there\xe2\x80\x99s no wind--you know what I\r\nmean?--and the street lamps shine through it...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know.... Excuse me...\xe2\x80\x9d muttered the stranger, frightened by the\r\nquestion and Raskolnikov\xe2\x80\x99s strange manner, and he crossed over to the\r\nother side of the street.\r\n\r\nRaskolnikov walked straight on and came out at the corner of the Hay\r\nMarket, where the huckster and his wife had talked with Lizaveta; but\r\nthey were not there now. Recognising the place, he stopped, looked round\r\nand addressed a young fellow in a red shirt who stood gaping before a\r\ncorn chandler\xe2\x80\x99s shop.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t there a man who keeps a booth with his wife at this corner?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll sorts of people keep booths here,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the young man, glancing\r\nsuperciliously at Raskolnikov.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s his name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat he was christened.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAren\xe2\x80\x99t you a Zara\xc3\xafsky man, too? Which province?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young man looked at Raskolnikov again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not a province, your excellency, but a district. Graciously\r\nforgive me, your excellency!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that a tavern at the top there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it\xe2\x80\x99s an eating-house and there\xe2\x80\x99s a billiard-room and you\xe2\x80\x99ll find\r\nprincesses there too.... La-la!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRaskolnikov crossed the square. In that corner there was a dense crowd\r\nof peasants. He pushed his way into the thickest part of it, looking\r\nat the faces. He felt an unaccountable inclination to enter into\r\nconversation with people. But the peasants took no notice of him; they\r\nwere all shouting in groups together. He stood and thought a little and\r\ntook a turning to the right in the direction of V.\r\n\r\nHe had often crossed that little street which turns at an angle, leading\r\nfrom the market-place to Sadovy Street. Of late he had often felt drawn\r\nto wander about this district, when he felt depressed, that he might\r\nfeel more so.\r\n\r\nNow he walked along, thinking of nothing. At that point there is a great\r\nblock of buildings, entirely let out in dram shops and eating-houses;\r\nwomen were continually running in and out, bare-headed and in their\r\nindoor clothes. Here and there they gathered in groups, on the pavement,\r\nespecially about the entrances to various festive establishments in\r\nthe lower storeys. From one of these a loud din, sounds of singing, the\r\ntinkling of a guitar and shouts of merriment, floated into the street.\r\nA crowd of women were thronging round the door; some were sitting on the\r\nsteps, others on the pavement, others were standing talking. A drunken\r\nsoldier, smoking a cigarette, was walking near them in the road,\r\nswearing; he seemed to be trying to find his way somewhere, but had\r\nforgotten where. One beggar was quarrelling with another, and a man dead\r\ndrunk was lying right across the road. Raskolnikov joined the throng of\r\nwomen, who were talking in husky voices. They were bare-headed and wore\r\ncotton dresses and goatskin shoes. There were women of forty and some\r\nnot more than seventeen; almost all had blackened eyes.\r\n\r\nHe felt strangely attracted by the singing and all the noise and\r\nuproar in the saloon below.... someone could be heard within dancing\r\nfrantically, marking time with his heels to the sounds of the guitar\r\nand of a thin falsetto voice singing a jaunty air. He listened intently,\r\ngloomily and dreamily, bending down at the entrance and peeping\r\ninquisitively in from the pavement.\r\n\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cOh, my handsome soldier\r\n   Don\xe2\x80\x99t beat me for nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\ntrilled the thin voice of the singer. Raskolnikov felt a great desire to\r\nmake out what he was singing, as though everything depended on that.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I go in?\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. \xe2\x80\x9cThey are laughing. From drink. Shall I get\r\ndrunk?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t you come in?\xe2\x80\x9d one of the women asked him. Her voice was\r\nstill musical and less thick than the others, she was young and not\r\nrepulsive--the only one of the group.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, she\xe2\x80\x99s pretty,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, drawing himself up and looking at her.\r\n\r\nShe smiled, much pleased at the compliment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re very nice looking yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t he thin though!\xe2\x80\x9d observed another woman in a deep bass. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you\r\njust come out of a hospital?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re all generals\xe2\x80\x99 daughters, it seems, but they have all snub\r\nnoses,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed a tipsy peasant with a sly smile on his face, wearing\r\na loose coat. \xe2\x80\x9cSee how jolly they are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo along with you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go, sweetie!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he darted down into the saloon below. Raskolnikov moved on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d the girl shouted after him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe hesitated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll always be pleased to spend an hour with you, kind gentleman, but\r\nnow I feel shy. Give me six copecks for a drink, there\xe2\x80\x99s a nice young\r\nman!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRaskolnikov gave her what came first--fifteen copecks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, what a good-natured gentleman!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s your name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAsk for Duclida.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, that\xe2\x80\x99s too much,\xe2\x80\x9d one of the women observed, shaking her head\r\nat Duclida. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know how you can ask like that. I believe I should\r\ndrop with shame....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRaskolnikov looked curiously at the speaker. She was a pock-marked wench\r\nof thirty, covered with bruises, with her upper lip swollen. She made\r\nher criticism quietly and earnestly. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere is it,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Raskolnikov.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is it I\xe2\x80\x99ve read that someone condemned to death says or thinks,\r\nan hour before his death, that if he had to live on some high rock,\r\non such a narrow ledge that he\xe2\x80\x99d only room to stand, and the ocean,\r\neverlasting darkness, everlasting solitude, everlasting tempest around\r\nhim, if he had to remain standing on a square yard of space all his\r\nlife, a thousand years, eternity, it were better to live so than to die\r\nat once! Only to live, to live and live! Life, whatever it may be!...\r\nHow true it is! Good God, how true! Man is a vile creature!... And vile\r\nis he who calls him vile for that,\xe2\x80\x9d he added a moment later.\r\n\r\nHe went into another street. \xe2\x80\x9cBah, the Palais de Cristal! Razumihin\r\nwas just talking of the Palais de Cristal. But what on earth was it\r\nI wanted? Yes, the newspapers.... Zossimov said he\xe2\x80\x99d read it in the\r\npapers. Have you the papers?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, going into a very spacious and\r\npositively clean restaurant, consisting of several rooms, which were,\r\nhowever, rather empty. Two or three people were drinking tea, and in a\r\nroom further away were sitting four men drinking champagne. Raskolnikov\r\nfancied that Zametov was one of them, but he could not be sure at that\r\ndistance. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat if it is?\xe2\x80\x9d he thought.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you have vodka?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the waiter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive me some tea and bring me the papers, the old ones for the last\r\nfive days, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you something.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir, here\xe2\x80\x99s to-day\xe2\x80\x99s. No vodka?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old newspapers and the tea were brought. Raskolnikov sat down and\r\nbegan to look through them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, damn... these are the items of intelligence. An accident on a\r\nstaircase, spontaneous combustion of a shopkeeper from alcohol, a fire\r\nin Peski... a fire in the Petersburg quarter... another fire in the\r\nPetersburg quarter... and another fire in the Petersburg quarter....\r\nAh, here it is!\xe2\x80\x9d He found at last what he was seeking and began to\r\nread it. The lines danced before his eyes, but he read it all and began\r\neagerly seeking later additions in the following numbers. His hands\r\nshook with nervous impatience as he turned the sheets. Suddenly someone\r\nsat down beside him at his table. He looked up, it was the head clerk\r\nZametov, looking just the same, with the rings on his fingers and the\r\nwatch-chain, with the curly, black hair, parted and pomaded, with the\r\nsmart waistcoat, rather shabby coat and doubtful linen. He was in a good\r\nhumour, at least he was smiling very gaily and good-humouredly. His dark\r\nface was rather flushed from the champagne he had drunk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, you here?\xe2\x80\x9d he began in surprise, speaking as though he\xe2\x80\x99d known\r\nhim all his life. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Razumihin told me only yesterday you were\r\nunconscious. How strange! And do you know I\xe2\x80\x99ve been to see you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRaskolnikov knew he would come up to him. He laid aside the papers and\r\nturned to Zametov. There was a smile on his lips, and a new shade of\r\nirritable impatience was apparent in that smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know you have,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve heard it. You looked for my\r\nsock.... And you know Razumihin has lost his heart to you? He says\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve been with him to Luise Ivanovna\xe2\x80\x99s--you know, the woman you tried\r\nto befriend, for whom you winked to the Explosive Lieutenant and he\r\nwould not understand. Do you remember? How could he fail to\r\nunderstand--it was quite clear, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a hot head he is!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe explosive one?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, your friend Razumihin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must have a jolly life, Mr. Zametov; entrance free to the most\r\nagreeable places. Who\xe2\x80\x99s been pouring champagne into you just now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve just been... having a drink together.... You talk about pouring\r\nit into me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy way of a fee! You profit by everything!\xe2\x80\x9d Raskolnikov laughed, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nall right, my dear boy,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, slapping Zametov on the shoulder. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nam not speaking from temper, but in a friendly way, for sport, as that\r\nworkman of yours said when he was scuffling with Dmitri, in the case of\r\nthe old woman....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you know about it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps I know more about it than you do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow strange you are.... I am sure you are still very unwell. You\r\noughtn\xe2\x80\x99t to have come out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, do I seem strange to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. What are you doing, reading the papers?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a lot about the fires.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I am not reading about the fires.\xe2\x80\x9d Here he looked mysteriously at\r\nZametov; his lips were twisted again in a mocking smile. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I am not\r\nreading about the fires,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, winking at Zametov. \xe2\x80\x9cBut confess\r\nnow, my dear fellow, you\xe2\x80\x99re awfully anxious to know what I am reading\r\nabout?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not in the least. Mayn\xe2\x80\x99t I ask a question? Why do you keep\r\non...?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen, you are a man of culture and education?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was in the sixth class at the gymnasium,\xe2\x80\x9d said Zametov with some\r\ndignity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSixth class! Ah, my cock-sparrow! With your parting and your rings--you\r\nare a gentleman of fortune. Foo! what a charming boy!\xe2\x80\x9d Here Raskolnikov\r\nbroke into a nervous laugh right in Zametov\xe2\x80\x99s face. The latter drew\r\nback, more amazed than offended.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFoo! how strange you are!\xe2\x80\x9d Zametov repeated very seriously. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhelp thinking you are still delirious.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am delirious? You are fibbing, my cock-sparrow! So I am strange? You\r\nfind me curious, do you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, curious.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I tell you what I was reading about, what I was looking for? See\r\nwhat a lot of papers I\xe2\x80\x99ve made them bring me. Suspicious, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou prick up your ears?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you mean--\xe2\x80\x98prick up my ears\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll explain that afterwards, but now, my boy, I declare to you... no,\r\nbetter \xe2\x80\x98I confess\xe2\x80\x99... No, that\xe2\x80\x99s not right either; \xe2\x80\x98I make a deposition\r\nand you take it.\xe2\x80\x99 I depose that I was reading, that I was looking and\r\nsearching....\xe2\x80\x9d he screwed up his eyes and paused. \xe2\x80\x9cI was searching--and\r\ncame here on purpose to do it--for news of the murder of the old\r\npawnbroker woman,\xe2\x80\x9d he articulated at last, almost in a whisper, bringing\r\nhis face exceedingly close to the face of Zametov. Zametov looked at him\r\nsteadily, without moving or drawing his face away. What struck Zametov\r\nafterwards as the strangest part of it all was that silence followed for\r\nexactly a minute, and that they gazed at one another all the while.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat if you have been reading about it?\xe2\x80\x9d he cried at last, perplexed\r\nand impatient. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s no business of mine! What of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe same old woman,\xe2\x80\x9d Raskolnikov went on in the same whisper, not\r\nheeding Zametov\xe2\x80\x99s explanation, \xe2\x80\x9cabout whom you were talking in the\r\npolice-office, you remember, when I fainted. Well, do you understand\r\nnow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean? Understand... what?\xe2\x80\x9d Zametov brought out, almost\r\nalarmed.\r\n\r\nRaskolnikov\xe2\x80\x99s set and earnest face was suddenly transformed, and he\r\nsuddenly went off into the same nervous laugh as before, as though\r\nutterly unable to restrain himself. And in one flash he recalled with\r\nextraordinary vividness of sensation a moment in the recent past, that\r\nmoment when he stood with the axe behind the door, while the latch\r\ntrembled and the men outside swore and shook it, and he had a sudden\r\ndesire to shout at them, to swear at them, to put out his tongue at\r\nthem, to mock them, to laugh, and laugh, and laugh!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are either mad, or...\xe2\x80\x9d began Zametov, and he broke off, as though\r\nstunned by the idea that had suddenly flashed into his mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr? Or what? What? Come, tell me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Zametov, getting angry, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s all nonsense!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBoth were silent. After his sudden fit of laughter Raskolnikov became\r\nsuddenly thoughtful and melancholy. He put his elbow on the table and\r\nleaned his head on his hand. He seemed to have completely forgotten\r\nZametov. The silence lasted for some time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you drink your tea? It\xe2\x80\x99s getting cold,\xe2\x80\x9d said Zametov.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! Tea? Oh, yes....\xe2\x80\x9d Raskolnikov sipped the glass, put a morsel of\r\nbread in his mouth and, suddenly looking at Zametov, seemed to remember\r\neverything and pulled himself together. At the same moment his face\r\nresumed its original mocking expression. He went on drinking tea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere have been a great many of these crimes lately,\xe2\x80\x9d said Zametov.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly the other day I read in the _Moscow News_ that a whole gang of\r\nfalse coiners had been caught in Moscow. It was a regular society. They\r\nused to forge tickets!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, but it was a long time ago! I read about it a month ago,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Raskolnikov answered calmly. \xe2\x80\x9cSo you consider them criminals?\xe2\x80\x9d he added,\r\nsmiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course they are criminals.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey? They are children, simpletons, not criminals! Why, half a hundred\r\npeople meeting for such an object--what an idea! Three would be too\r\nmany, and then they want to have more faith in one another than in\r\nthemselves! One has only to blab in his cups and it all collapses.\r\nSimpletons! They engaged untrustworthy people to change the notes--what\r\na thing to trust to a casual stranger! Well, let us suppose that these\r\nsimpletons succeed and each makes a million, and what follows for the\r\nrest of their lives? Each is dependent on the others for the rest of his\r\nlife! Better hang oneself at once! And they did not know how to change\r\nthe notes either; the man who changed the notes took five thousand\r\nroubles, and his hands trembled. He counted the first four thousand,\r\nbut did not count the fifth thousand--he was in such a hurry to get the\r\nmoney into his pocket and run away. Of course he roused suspicion. And\r\nthe whole thing came to a crash through one fool! Is it possible?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat his hands trembled?\xe2\x80\x9d observed Zametov, \xe2\x80\x9cyes, that\xe2\x80\x99s quite\r\npossible. That, I feel quite sure, is possible. Sometimes one can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nstand things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t stand that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, could you stand it then? No, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t. For the sake of a hundred\r\nroubles to face such a terrible experience? To go with false notes\r\ninto a bank where it\xe2\x80\x99s their business to spot that sort of thing! No, I\r\nshould not have the face to do it. Would you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRaskolnikov had an intense desire again \xe2\x80\x9cto put his tongue out.\xe2\x80\x9d Shivers\r\nkept running down his spine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should do it quite differently,\xe2\x80\x9d Raskolnikov began. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is how I\r\nwould change the notes: I\xe2\x80\x99d count the first thousand three or four times\r\nbackwards and forwards, looking at every note and then I\xe2\x80\x99d set to the\r\nsecond thousand; I\xe2\x80\x99d count that half-way through and then hold some\r\nfifty-rouble note to the light, then turn it, then hold it to the light\r\nagain--to see whether it was a good one. \xe2\x80\x98I am afraid,\xe2\x80\x99 I would say, \xe2\x80\x98a\r\nrelation of mine lost twenty-five roubles the other day through a\r\nfalse note,\xe2\x80\x99 and then I\xe2\x80\x99d tell them the whole story. And after I began\r\ncounting the third, \xe2\x80\x98No, excuse me,\xe2\x80\x99 I would say, \xe2\x80\x98I fancy I made a\r\nmistake in the seventh hundred in that second thousand, I am not sure.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nAnd so I would give up the third thousand and go back to the second and\r\nso on to the end. And when I had finished, I\xe2\x80\x99d pick out one from the\r\nfifth and one from the second thousand and take them again to the light\r\nand ask again, \xe2\x80\x98Change them, please,\xe2\x80\x99 and put the clerk into such a stew\r\nthat he would not know how to get rid of me. When I\xe2\x80\x99d finished and had\r\ngone out, I\xe2\x80\x99d come back, \xe2\x80\x98No, excuse me,\xe2\x80\x99 and ask for some explanation.\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s how I\xe2\x80\x99d do it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFoo! what terrible things you say!\xe2\x80\x9d said Zametov, laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cBut all\r\nthat is only talk. I dare say when it came to deeds you\xe2\x80\x99d make a slip.\r\nI believe that even a practised, desperate man cannot always reckon on\r\nhimself, much less you and I. To take an example near home--that old\r\nwoman murdered in our district. The murderer seems to have been a\r\ndesperate fellow, he risked everything in open daylight, was saved by\r\na miracle--but his hands shook, too. He did not succeed in robbing the\r\nplace, he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stand it. That was clear from the...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRaskolnikov seemed offended.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cClear? Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you catch him then?\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, maliciously gibing at\r\nZametov.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, they will catch him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho? You? Do you suppose you could catch him? You\xe2\x80\x99ve a tough job! A\r\ngreat point for you is whether a man is spending money or not. If he had\r\nno money and suddenly begins spending, he must be the man. So that any\r\nchild can mislead you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe fact is they always do that, though,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Zametov. \xe2\x80\x9cA man will\r\ncommit a clever murder at the risk of his life and then at once he goes\r\ndrinking in a tavern. They are caught spending money, they are not all\r\nas cunning as you are. You wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go to a tavern, of course?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRaskolnikov frowned and looked steadily at Zametov.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou seem to enjoy the subject and would like to know how I should\r\nbehave in that case, too?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked with displeasure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should like to,\xe2\x80\x9d Zametov answered firmly and seriously. Somewhat too\r\nmuch earnestness began to appear in his words and looks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery much?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery much!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right then. This is how I should behave,\xe2\x80\x9d Raskolnikov began, again\r\nbringing his face close to Zametov\xe2\x80\x99s, again staring at him and speaking\r\nin a whisper, so that the latter positively shuddered. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is what\r\nI should have done. I should have taken the money and jewels, I should\r\nhave walked out of there and have gone straight to some deserted place\r\nwith fences round it and scarcely anyone to be seen, some kitchen garden\r\nor place of that sort. I should have looked out beforehand some stone\r\nweighing a hundredweight or more which had been lying in the corner from\r\nthe time the house was built. I would lift that stone--there would sure\r\nto be a hollow under it, and I would put the jewels and money in that\r\nhole. Then I\xe2\x80\x99d roll the stone back so that it would look as before,\r\nwould press it down with my foot and walk away. And for a year or two,\r\nthree maybe, I would not touch it. And, well, they could search! There\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nbe no trace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a madman,\xe2\x80\x9d said Zametov, and for some reason he too spoke in a\r\nwhisper, and moved away from Raskolnikov, whose eyes were glittering. He\r\nhad turned fearfully pale and his upper lip was twitching and quivering.\r\nHe bent down as close as possible to Zametov, and his lips began to move\r\nwithout uttering a word. This lasted for half a minute; he knew what he\r\nwas doing, but could not restrain himself. The terrible word trembled on\r\nhis lips, like the latch on that door; in another moment it will break\r\nout, in another moment he will let it go, he will speak out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what if it was I who murdered the old woman and Lizaveta?\xe2\x80\x9d he said\r\nsuddenly and--realised what he had done.\r\n\r\nZametov looked wildly at him and turned white as the tablecloth. His\r\nface wore a contorted smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut is it possible?\xe2\x80\x9d he brought out faintly. Raskolnikov looked\r\nwrathfully at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOwn up that you believed it, yes, you did?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a bit of it, I believe it less than ever now,\xe2\x80\x9d Zametov cried\r\nhastily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve caught my cock-sparrow! So you did believe it before, if now you\r\nbelieve less than ever?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Zametov, obviously embarrassed. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you been\r\nfrightening me so as to lead up to this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t believe it then? What were you talking about behind my\r\nback when I went out of the police-office? And why did the explosive\r\nlieutenant question me after I fainted? Hey, there,\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted to the\r\nwaiter, getting up and taking his cap, \xe2\x80\x9chow much?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThirty copecks,\xe2\x80\x9d the latter replied, running up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd there is twenty copecks for vodka. See what a lot of money!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nheld out his shaking hand to Zametov with notes in it. \xe2\x80\x9cRed notes and\r\nblue, twenty-five roubles. Where did I get them? And where did my new\r\nclothes come from? You know I had not a copeck. You\xe2\x80\x99ve cross-examined my\r\nlandlady, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be bound.... Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s enough! _Assez caus\xc3\xa9!_ Till we\r\nmeet again!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe went out, trembling all over from a sort of wild hysterical\r\nsensation, in which there was an element of insufferable rapture. Yet he\r\nwas gloomy and terribly tired. His face was twisted as after a fit.\r\nHis fatigue increased rapidly. Any shock, any irritating sensation\r\nstimulated and revived his energies at once, but his strength failed as\r\nquickly when the stimulus was removed.\r\n\r\nZametov, left alone, sat for a long time in the same place, plunged in\r\nthought. Raskolnikov had unwittingly worked a revolution in his brain on\r\na certain point and had made up his mind for him conclusively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIlya Petrovitch is a blockhead,\xe2\x80\x9d he decided.\r\n\r\nRaskolnikov had hardly opened the door of the restaurant when he\r\nstumbled against Razumihin on the steps. They did not see each other\r\ntill they almost knocked against each other. For a moment they stood\r\nlooking each other up and down. Razumihin was greatly astounded, then\r\nanger, real anger gleamed fiercely in his eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo here you are!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted at the top of his voice--\xe2\x80\x9cyou ran away\r\nfrom your bed! And here I\xe2\x80\x99ve been looking for you under the sofa! We\r\nwent up to the garret. I almost beat Nastasya on your account. And here\r\nhe is after all. Rodya! What is the meaning of it? Tell me the whole\r\ntruth! Confess! Do you hear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt means that I\xe2\x80\x99m sick to death of you all and I want to be alone,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Raskolnikov answered calmly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlone? When you are not able to walk, when your face is as white as a\r\nsheet and you are gasping for breath! Idiot!... What have you been doing\r\nin the Palais de Cristal? Own up at once!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me go!\xe2\x80\x9d said Raskolnikov and tried to pass him. This was too much\r\nfor Razumihin; he gripped him firmly by the shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet you go? You dare tell me to let you go? Do you know what I\xe2\x80\x99ll do\r\nwith you directly? I\xe2\x80\x99ll pick you up, tie you up in a bundle, carry you\r\nhome under my arm and lock you up!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen, Razumihin,\xe2\x80\x9d Raskolnikov began quietly, apparently calm--\xe2\x80\x9ccan\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou see that I don\xe2\x80\x99t want your benevolence? A strange desire you have to\r\nshower benefits on a man who... curses them, who feels them a burden in\r\nfact! Why did you seek me out at the beginning of my illness? Maybe I\r\nwas very glad to die. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t I tell you plainly enough to-day that\r\nyou were torturing me, that I was... sick of you! You seem to want to\r\ntorture people! I assure you that all that is seriously hindering my\r\nrecovery, because it\xe2\x80\x99s continually irritating me. You saw Zossimov\r\nwent away just now to avoid irritating me. You leave me alone too, for\r\ngoodness\xe2\x80\x99 sake! What right have you, indeed, to keep me by force? Don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou see that I am in possession of all my faculties now? How, how can\r\nI persuade you not to persecute me with your kindness? I may be\r\nungrateful, I may be mean, only let me be, for God\xe2\x80\x99s sake, let me be!\r\nLet me be, let me be!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe began calmly, gloating beforehand over the venomous phrases he was\r\nabout to utter, but finished, panting for breath, in a frenzy, as he had\r\nbeen with Luzhin.\r\n\r\nRazumihin stood a moment, thought and let his hand drop.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, go to hell then,\xe2\x80\x9d he said gently and thoughtfully. \xe2\x80\x9cStay,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nroared, as Raskolnikov was about to move. \xe2\x80\x9cListen to me. Let me tell\r\nyou, that you are all a set of babbling, posing idiots! If you\xe2\x80\x99ve any\r\nlittle trouble you brood over it like a hen over an egg. And you are\r\nplagiarists even in that! There isn\xe2\x80\x99t a sign of independent life in\r\nyou! You are made of spermaceti ointment and you\xe2\x80\x99ve lymph in your veins\r\ninstead of blood. I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe in anyone of you! In any circumstances\r\nthe first thing for all of you is to be unlike a human being! Stop!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ncried with redoubled fury, noticing that Raskolnikov was again making\r\na movement--\xe2\x80\x9chear me out! You know I\xe2\x80\x99m having a house-warming this\r\nevening, I dare say they\xe2\x80\x99ve arrived by now, but I left my uncle there--I\r\njust ran in--to receive the guests. And if you weren\xe2\x80\x99t a fool, a common\r\nfool, a perfect fool, if you were an original instead of a translation...\r\nyou see, Rodya, I recognise you\xe2\x80\x99re a clever fellow, but you\xe2\x80\x99re a\r\nfool!--and if you weren\xe2\x80\x99t a fool you\xe2\x80\x99d come round to me this evening\r\ninstead of wearing out your boots in the street! Since you have gone\r\nout, there\xe2\x80\x99s no help for it! I\xe2\x80\x99d give you a snug easy chair, my landlady\r\nhas one... a cup of tea, company.... Or you could lie on the sofa--any\r\nway you would be with us.... Zossimov will be there too. Will you come?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cR-rubbish!\xe2\x80\x9d Razumihin shouted, out of patience. \xe2\x80\x9cHow do you know?\r\nYou can\xe2\x80\x99t answer for yourself! You don\xe2\x80\x99t know anything about it....\r\nThousands of times I\xe2\x80\x99ve fought tooth and nail with people and run back\r\nto them afterwards.... One feels ashamed and goes back to a man! So\r\nremember, Potchinkov\xe2\x80\x99s house on the third storey....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Mr. Razumihin, I do believe you\xe2\x80\x99d let anybody beat you from sheer\r\nbenevolence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeat? Whom? Me? I\xe2\x80\x99d twist his nose off at the mere idea! Potchinkov\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhouse, 47, Babushkin\xe2\x80\x99s flat....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall not come, Razumihin.\xe2\x80\x9d Raskolnikov turned and walked away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI bet you will,\xe2\x80\x9d Razumihin shouted after him. \xe2\x80\x9cI refuse to know you if\r\nyou don\xe2\x80\x99t! Stay, hey, is Zametov in there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you see him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTalked to him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat about? Confound you, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell me then. Potchinkov\xe2\x80\x99s house, 47,\r\nBabushkin\xe2\x80\x99s flat, remember!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRaskolnikov walked on and turned the corner into Sadovy Street.\r\nRazumihin looked after him thoughtfully. Then with a wave of his hand he\r\nwent into the house but stopped short of the stairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConfound it,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on almost aloud. \xe2\x80\x9cHe talked sensibly but yet...\r\nI am a fool! As if madmen didn\xe2\x80\x99t talk sensibly! And this was just what\r\nZossimov seemed afraid of.\xe2\x80\x9d He struck his finger on his forehead. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\nif... how could I let him go off alone? He may drown himself.... Ach,\r\nwhat a blunder! I can\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d And he ran back to overtake Raskolnikov, but\r\nthere was no trace of him. With a curse he returned with rapid steps to\r\nthe Palais de Cristal to question Zametov.\r\n\r\nRaskolnikov walked straight to X---- Bridge, stood in the middle, and\r\nleaning both elbows on the rail stared into the distance. On parting\r\nwith Razumihin, he felt so much weaker that he could scarcely reach this\r\nplace. He longed to sit or lie down somewhere in the street. Bending\r\nover the water, he gazed mechanically at the last pink flush of the\r\nsunset, at the row of houses growing dark in the gathering twilight, at\r\none distant attic window on the left bank, flashing as though on fire in\r\nthe last rays of the setting sun, at the darkening water of the canal,\r\nand the water seemed to catch his attention. At last red circles flashed\r\nbefore his eyes, the houses seemed moving, the passers-by, the canal\r\nbanks, the carriages, all danced before his eyes. Suddenly he started,\r\nsaved again perhaps from swooning by an uncanny and hideous sight. He\r\nbecame aware of someone standing on the right side of him; he looked\r\nand saw a tall woman with a kerchief on her head, with a long, yellow,\r\nwasted face and red sunken eyes. She was looking straight at him, but\r\nobviously she saw nothing and recognised no one. Suddenly she leaned her\r\nright hand on the parapet, lifted her right leg over the railing, then\r\nher left and threw herself into the canal. The filthy water parted and\r\nswallowed up its victim for a moment, but an instant later the drowning\r\nwoman floated to the surface, moving slowly with the current, her head\r\nand legs in the water, her skirt inflated like a balloon over her back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA woman drowning! A woman drowning!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted dozens of voices; people\r\nran up, both banks were thronged with spectators, on the bridge people\r\ncrowded about Raskolnikov, pressing up behind him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMercy on it! it\xe2\x80\x99s our Afrosinya!\xe2\x80\x9d a woman cried tearfully close by.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMercy! save her! kind people, pull her out!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA boat, a boat\xe2\x80\x9d was shouted in the crowd. But there was no need of a\r\nboat; a policeman ran down the steps to the canal, threw off his great\r\ncoat and his boots and rushed into the water. It was easy to reach her:\r\nshe floated within a couple of yards from the steps, he caught hold of\r\nher clothes with his right hand and with his left seized a pole which a\r\ncomrade held out to him; the drowning woman was pulled out at once. They\r\nlaid her on the granite pavement of the embankment. She soon recovered\r\nconsciousness, raised her head, sat up and began sneezing and coughing,\r\nstupidly wiping her wet dress with her hands. She said nothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s drunk herself out of her senses,\xe2\x80\x9d the same woman\xe2\x80\x99s voice wailed\r\nat her side. \xe2\x80\x9cOut of her senses. The other day she tried to hang\r\nherself, we cut her down. I ran out to the shop just now, left my little\r\ngirl to look after her--and here she\xe2\x80\x99s in trouble again! A neighbour,\r\ngentleman, a neighbour, we live close by, the second house from the end,\r\nsee yonder....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe crowd broke up. The police still remained round the woman, someone\r\nmentioned the police station.... Raskolnikov looked on with a strange\r\nsensation of indifference and apathy. He felt disgusted. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nloathsome... water... it\xe2\x80\x99s not good enough,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered to himself.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing will come of it,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, \xe2\x80\x9cno use to wait. What about the\r\npolice office...? And why isn\xe2\x80\x99t Zametov at the police office? The police\r\noffice is open till ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock....\xe2\x80\x9d He turned his back to the railing\r\nand looked about him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well then!\xe2\x80\x9d he said resolutely; he moved from the bridge and\r\nwalked in the direction of the police office. His heart felt hollow and\r\nempty. He did not want to think. Even his depression had passed, there\r\nwas not a trace now of the energy with which he had set out \xe2\x80\x9cto make an\r\nend of it all.\xe2\x80\x9d Complete apathy had succeeded to it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it\xe2\x80\x99s a way out of it,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, walking slowly and listlessly\r\nalong the canal bank. \xe2\x80\x9cAnyway I\xe2\x80\x99ll make an end, for I want to.... But\r\nis it a way out? What does it matter! There\xe2\x80\x99ll be the square yard of\r\nspace--ha! But what an end! Is it really the end? Shall I tell them or\r\nnot? Ah... damn! How tired I am! If I could find somewhere to sit or lie\r\ndown soon! What I am most ashamed of is its being so stupid. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncare about that either! What idiotic ideas come into one\xe2\x80\x99s head.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo reach the police office he had to go straight forward and take the\r\nsecond turning to the left. It was only a few paces away. But at the\r\nfirst turning he stopped and, after a minute\xe2\x80\x99s thought, turned into a\r\nside street and went two streets out of his way, possibly without any\r\nobject, or possibly to delay a minute and gain time. He walked, looking\r\nat the ground; suddenly someone seemed to whisper in his ear; he lifted\r\nhis head and saw that he was standing at the very gate of _the_ house.\r\nHe had not passed it, he had not been near it since _that_ evening.\r\nAn overwhelming, unaccountable prompting drew him on. He went into the\r\nhouse, passed through the gateway, then into the first entrance on the\r\nright, and began mounting the familiar staircase to the fourth storey.\r\nThe narrow, steep staircase was very dark. He stopped at each landing\r\nand looked round him with curiosity; on the first landing the framework\r\nof the window had been taken out. \xe2\x80\x9cThat wasn\xe2\x80\x99t so then,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought.\r\nHere was the flat on the second storey where Nikolay and Dmitri had been\r\nworking. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s shut up and the door newly painted. So it\xe2\x80\x99s to let.\xe2\x80\x9d Then\r\nthe third storey and the fourth. \xe2\x80\x9cHere!\xe2\x80\x9d He was perplexed to find the\r\ndoor of the flat wide open. There were men there, he could hear voices;\r\nhe had not expected that. After brief hesitation he mounted the last\r\nstairs and went into the flat. It, too, was being done up; there were\r\nworkmen in it. This seemed to amaze him; he somehow fancied that he\r\nwould find everything as he left it, even perhaps the corpses in the\r\nsame places on the floor. And now, bare walls, no furniture; it seemed\r\nstrange. He walked to the window and sat down on the window-sill. There\r\nwere two workmen, both young fellows, but one much younger than the\r\nother. They were papering the walls with a new white paper covered with\r\nlilac flowers, instead of the old, dirty, yellow one. Raskolnikov for\r\nsome reason felt horribly annoyed by this. He looked at the new paper\r\nwith dislike, as though he felt sorry to have it all so changed.\r\nThe workmen had obviously stayed beyond their time and now they were\r\nhurriedly rolling up their paper and getting ready to go home. They took\r\nno notice of Raskolnikov\xe2\x80\x99s coming in; they were talking. Raskolnikov\r\nfolded his arms and listened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe comes to me in the morning,\xe2\x80\x9d said the elder to the younger, \xe2\x80\x9cvery\r\nearly, all dressed up. \xe2\x80\x98Why are you preening and prinking?\xe2\x80\x99 says I. \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nam ready to do anything to please you, Tit Vassilitch!\xe2\x80\x99 That\xe2\x80\x99s a way of\r\ngoing on! And she dressed up like a regular fashion book!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what is a fashion book?\xe2\x80\x9d the younger one asked. He obviously\r\nregarded the other as an authority.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA fashion book is a lot of pictures, coloured, and they come to the\r\ntailors here every Saturday, by post from abroad, to show folks how\r\nto dress, the male sex as well as the female. They\xe2\x80\x99re pictures. The\r\ngentlemen are generally wearing fur coats and for the ladies\xe2\x80\x99 fluffles,\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99re beyond anything you can fancy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing you can\xe2\x80\x99t find in Petersburg,\xe2\x80\x9d the younger cried\r\nenthusiastically, \xe2\x80\x9cexcept father and mother, there\xe2\x80\x99s everything!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcept them, there\xe2\x80\x99s everything to be found, my boy,\xe2\x80\x9d the elder\r\ndeclared sententiously.\r\n\r\nRaskolnikov got up and walked into the other room where the strong box,\r\nthe bed, and the chest of drawers had been; the room seemed to him very\r\ntiny without furniture in it. The paper was the same; the paper in the\r\ncorner showed where the case of ikons had stood. He looked at it and\r\nwent to the window. The elder workman looked at him askance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked suddenly.\r\n\r\nInstead of answering Raskolnikov went into the passage and pulled the\r\nbell. The same bell, the same cracked note. He rang it a second and\r\na third time; he listened and remembered. The hideous and agonisingly\r\nfearful sensation he had felt then began to come back more and more\r\nvividly. He shuddered at every ring and it gave him more and more\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what do you want? Who are you?\xe2\x80\x9d the workman shouted, going out to\r\nhim. Raskolnikov went inside again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to take a flat,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI am looking round.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not the time to look at rooms at night! and you ought to come up\r\nwith the porter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe floors have been washed, will they be painted?\xe2\x80\x9d Raskolnikov went\r\non. \xe2\x80\x9cIs there no blood?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat blood?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, the old woman and her sister were murdered here. There was a\r\nperfect pool there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut who are you?\xe2\x80\x9d the workman cried, uneasy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho am I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou want to know? Come to the police station, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe workmen looked at him in amazement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s time for us to go, we are late. Come along, Alyoshka. We must lock\r\nup,\xe2\x80\x9d said the elder workman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, come along,\xe2\x80\x9d said Raskolnikov indifferently, and going\r\nout first, he went slowly downstairs. \xe2\x80\x9cHey, porter,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried in the\r\ngateway.\r\n\r\nAt the entrance several people were standing, staring at the passers-by;\r\nthe two porters, a peasant woman, a man in a long coat and a few others.\r\nRaskolnikov went straight up to them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d asked one of the porters.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you been to the police office?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve just been there. What do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it open?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs the assistant there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was there for a time. What do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRaskolnikov made no reply, but stood beside them lost in thought.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s been to look at the flat,\xe2\x80\x9d said the elder workman, coming forward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich flat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere we are at work. \xe2\x80\x98Why have you washed away the blood?\xe2\x80\x99 says he.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There has been a murder here,\xe2\x80\x99 says he, \xe2\x80\x98and I\xe2\x80\x99ve come to take it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nAnd he began ringing at the bell, all but broke it. \xe2\x80\x98Come to the police\r\nstation,\xe2\x80\x99 says he. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you everything there.\xe2\x80\x99 He wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t leave\r\nus.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe porter looked at Raskolnikov, frowning and perplexed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho are you?\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted as impressively as he could.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikov, formerly a student, I live in\r\nShil\xe2\x80\x99s house, not far from here, flat Number 14, ask the porter, he\r\nknows me.\xe2\x80\x9d Raskolnikov said all this in a lazy, dreamy voice, not\r\nturning round, but looking intently into the darkening street.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy have you been to the flat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo look at it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is there to look at?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake him straight to the police station,\xe2\x80\x9d the man in the long coat\r\njerked in abruptly.\r\n\r\nRaskolnikov looked intently at him over his shoulder and said in the\r\nsame slow, lazy tones:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome along.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, take him,\xe2\x80\x9d the man went on more confidently. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy was he going\r\ninto _that_, what\xe2\x80\x99s in his mind, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s not drunk, but God knows what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with him,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered the\r\nworkman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d the porter shouted again, beginning to get angry\r\nin earnest--\xe2\x80\x9cWhy are you hanging about?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou funk the police station then?\xe2\x80\x9d said Raskolnikov jeeringly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow funk it? Why are you hanging about?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a rogue!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the peasant woman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy waste time talking to him?\xe2\x80\x9d cried the other porter, a huge peasant\r\nin a full open coat and with keys on his belt. \xe2\x80\x9cGet along! He is a rogue\r\nand no mistake. Get along!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd seizing Raskolnikov by the shoulder he flung him into the street. He\r\nlurched forward, but recovered his footing, looked at the spectators in\r\nsilence and walked away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStrange man!\xe2\x80\x9d observed the workman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are strange folks about nowadays,\xe2\x80\x9d said the woman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou should have taken him to the police station all the same,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nman in the long coat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetter have nothing to do with him,\xe2\x80\x9d decided the big porter. \xe2\x80\x9cA regular\r\nrogue! Just what he wants, you may be sure, but once take him up, you\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t get rid of him.... We know the sort!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I go there or not?\xe2\x80\x9d thought Raskolnikov, standing in the middle\r\nof the thoroughfare at the cross-roads, and he looked about him, as\r\nthough expecting from someone a decisive word. But no sound came, all\r\nwas dead and silent like the stones on which he walked, dead to him, to\r\nhim alone.... All at once at the end of the street, two hundred yards\r\naway, in the gathering dusk he saw a crowd and heard talk and shouts.\r\nIn the middle of the crowd stood a carriage.... A light gleamed in the\r\nmiddle of the street. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d Raskolnikov turned to the right\r\nand went up to the crowd. He seemed to clutch at everything and smiled\r\ncoldly when he recognised it, for he had fully made up his mind to go to\r\nthe police station and knew that it would all soon be over.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nAn elegant carriage stood in the middle of the road with a pair of\r\nspirited grey horses; there was no one in it, and the coachman had got\r\noff his box and stood by; the horses were being held by the bridle....\r\nA mass of people had gathered round, the police standing in front. One\r\nof them held a lighted lantern which he was turning on something lying\r\nclose to the wheels. Everyone was talking, shouting, exclaiming; the\r\ncoachman seemed at a loss and kept repeating:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a misfortune! Good Lord, what a misfortune!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRaskolnikov pushed his way in as far as he could, and succeeded at last\r\nin seeing the object of the commotion and interest. On the ground a\r\nman who had been run over lay apparently unconscious, and covered with\r\nblood; he was very badly dressed, but not like a workman. Blood was\r\nflowing from his head and face; his face was crushed, mutilated and\r\ndisfigured. He was evidently badly injured.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMerciful heaven!\xe2\x80\x9d wailed the coachman, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat more could I do? If I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nbeen driving fast or had not shouted to him, but I was going quietly,\r\nnot in a hurry. Everyone could see I was going along just like everybody\r\nelse. A drunken man can\xe2\x80\x99t walk straight, we all know.... I saw him\r\ncrossing the street, staggering and almost falling. I shouted again\r\nand a second and a third time, then I held the horses in, but he fell\r\nstraight under their feet! Either he did it on purpose or he was very\r\ntipsy.... The horses are young and ready to take fright... they started,\r\nhe screamed... that made them worse. That\xe2\x80\x99s how it happened!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s just how it was,\xe2\x80\x9d a voice in the crowd confirmed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe shouted, that\xe2\x80\x99s true, he shouted three times,\xe2\x80\x9d another voice\r\ndeclared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree times it was, we all heard it,\xe2\x80\x9d shouted a third.\r\n\r\nBut the coachman was not very much distressed and frightened. It was\r\nevident that the carriage belonged to a rich and important person who\r\nwas awaiting it somewhere; the police, of course, were in no little\r\nanxiety to avoid upsetting his arrangements. All they had to do was to\r\ntake the injured man to the police station and the hospital. No one knew\r\nhis name.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Raskolnikov had squeezed in and stooped closer over him. The\r\nlantern suddenly lighted up the unfortunate man\xe2\x80\x99s face. He recognised\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know him! I know him!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted, pushing to the front. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\ngovernment clerk retired from the service, Marmeladov. He lives close\r\nby in Kozel\xe2\x80\x99s house.... Make haste for a doctor! I will pay, see?\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\npulled money out of his pocket and showed it to the policeman. He was in\r\nviolent agitation.\r\n\r\nThe police were glad that they had found out who the man was.\r\nRaskolnikov gave his own name and address, and, as earnestly as if it\r\nhad been his father, he besought the police to carry the unconscious\r\nMarmeladov to his lodging at once.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust here, three houses away,\xe2\x80\x9d he said eagerly, \xe2\x80\x9cthe house belongs to\r\nKozel, a rich German. He was going home, no doubt drunk. I know him,\r\nhe is a drunkard. He has a family there, a wife, children, he has one\r\ndaughter.... It will take time to take him to the hospital, and there is\r\nsure to be a doctor in the house. I\xe2\x80\x99ll pay, I\xe2\x80\x99ll pay! At least he will\r\nbe looked after at home... they will help him at once. But he\xe2\x80\x99ll die\r\nbefore you get him to the hospital.\xe2\x80\x9d He managed to slip something\r\nunseen into the policeman\xe2\x80\x99s hand. But the thing was straightforward\r\nand legitimate, and in any case help was closer here. They raised the\r\ninjured man; people volunteered to help.\r\n\r\nKozel\xe2\x80\x99s house was thirty yards away. Raskolnikov walked behind,\r\ncarefully holding Marmeladov\xe2\x80\x99s head and showing the way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis way, this way! We must take him upstairs head foremost. Turn\r\nround! I\xe2\x80\x99ll pay, I\xe2\x80\x99ll make it worth your while,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered.\r\n\r\nKaterina Ivanovna had just begun, as she always did at every free\r\nmoment, walking to and fro in her little room from window to stove and\r\nback again, with her arms folded across her chest, talking to herself\r\nand coughing. Of late she had begun to talk more than ever to her eldest\r\ngirl, Polenka, a child of ten, who, though there was much she did not\r\nunderstand, understood very well that her mother needed her, and so\r\nalways watched her with her big clever eyes and strove her utmost\r\nto appear to understand. This time Polenka was undressing her little\r\nbrother, who had been unwell all day and was going to bed. The boy was\r\nwaiting for her to take off his shirt, which had to be washed at night.\r\nHe was sitting straight and motionless on a chair, with a silent,\r\nserious face, with his legs stretched out straight before him--heels\r\ntogether and toes turned out.\r\n\r\nHe was listening to what his mother was saying to his sister, sitting\r\nperfectly still with pouting lips and wide-open eyes, just as all good\r\nlittle boys have to sit when they are undressed to go to bed. A little\r\ngirl, still younger, dressed literally in rags, stood at the screen,\r\nwaiting for her turn. The door on to the stairs was open to relieve\r\nthem a little from the clouds of tobacco smoke which floated in from the\r\nother rooms and brought on long terrible fits of coughing in the poor,\r\nconsumptive woman. Katerina Ivanovna seemed to have grown even thinner\r\nduring that week and the hectic flush on her face was brighter than\r\never.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t believe, you can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine, Polenka,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, walking\r\nabout the room, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat a happy luxurious life we had in my papa\xe2\x80\x99s house\r\nand how this drunkard has brought me, and will bring you all, to ruin!\r\nPapa was a civil colonel and only a step from being a governor; so that\r\neveryone who came to see him said, \xe2\x80\x98We look upon you, Ivan Mihailovitch,\r\nas our governor!\xe2\x80\x99 When I... when...\xe2\x80\x9d she coughed violently, \xe2\x80\x9coh, cursed\r\nlife,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, clearing her throat and pressing her hands to her\r\nbreast, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen I... when at the last ball... at the marshal\xe2\x80\x99s...\r\nPrincess Bezzemelny saw me--who gave me the blessing when your father\r\nand I were married, Polenka--she asked at once \xe2\x80\x98Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that the pretty\r\ngirl who danced the shawl dance at the breaking-up?\xe2\x80\x99 (You must mend\r\nthat tear, you must take your needle and darn it as I showed you, or\r\nto-morrow--cough, cough, cough--he will make the hole bigger,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\narticulated with effort.) \xe2\x80\x9cPrince Schegolskoy, a kammerjunker, had just\r\ncome from Petersburg then... he danced the mazurka with me and wanted to\r\nmake me an offer next day; but I thanked him in flattering expressions\r\nand told him that my heart had long been another\xe2\x80\x99s. That other was your\r\nfather, Polya; papa was fearfully angry.... Is the water ready? Give me\r\nthe shirt, and the stockings! Lida,\xe2\x80\x9d said she to the youngest one, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\r\nmust manage without your chemise to-night... and lay your stockings out\r\nwith it... I\xe2\x80\x99ll wash them together.... How is it that drunken vagabond\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t come in? He has worn his shirt till it looks like a dish-clout,\r\nhe has torn it to rags! I\xe2\x80\x99d do it all together, so as not to have to\r\nwork two nights running! Oh, dear! (Cough, cough, cough, cough!) Again!\r\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s this?\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, noticing a crowd in the passage and the men,\r\nwho were pushing into her room, carrying a burden. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it? What are\r\nthey bringing? Mercy on us!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are we to put him?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the policeman, looking round when\r\nMarmeladov, unconscious and covered with blood, had been carried in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the sofa! Put him straight on the sofa, with his head this way,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Raskolnikov showed him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRun over in the road! Drunk!\xe2\x80\x9d someone shouted in the passage.\r\n\r\nKaterina Ivanovna stood, turning white and gasping for breath. The\r\nchildren were terrified. Little Lida screamed, rushed to Polenka and\r\nclutched at her, trembling all over.\r\n\r\nHaving laid Marmeladov down, Raskolnikov flew to Katerina Ivanovna.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor God\xe2\x80\x99s sake be calm, don\xe2\x80\x99t be frightened!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, speaking\r\nquickly, \xe2\x80\x9che was crossing the road and was run over by a carriage, don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbe frightened, he will come to, I told them bring him here... I\xe2\x80\x99ve been\r\nhere already, you remember? He will come to; I\xe2\x80\x99ll pay!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s done it this time!\xe2\x80\x9d Katerina Ivanovna cried despairingly and she\r\nrushed to her husband.\r\n\r\nRaskolnikov noticed at once that she was not one of those women who\r\nswoon easily. She instantly placed under the luckless man\xe2\x80\x99s head a\r\npillow, which no one had thought of and began undressing and examining\r\nhim. She kept her head, forgetting herself, biting her trembling lips\r\nand stifling the screams which were ready to break from her.\r\n\r\nRaskolnikov meanwhile induced someone to run for a doctor. There was a\r\ndoctor, it appeared, next door but one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve sent for a doctor,\xe2\x80\x9d he kept assuring Katerina Ivanovna, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\nuneasy, I\xe2\x80\x99ll pay. Haven\xe2\x80\x99t you water?... and give me a napkin or a towel,\r\nanything, as quick as you can.... He is injured, but not killed, believe\r\nme.... We shall see what the doctor says!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKaterina Ivanovna ran to the window; there, on a broken chair in the\r\ncorner, a large earthenware basin full of water had been stood, in\r\nreadiness for washing her children\xe2\x80\x99s and husband\xe2\x80\x99s linen that night.\r\nThis washing was done by Katerina Ivanovna at night at least twice a\r\nweek, if not oftener. For the family had come to such a pass that they\r\nwere practically without change of linen, and Katerina Ivanovna could\r\nnot endure uncleanliness and, rather than see dirt in the house, she\r\npreferred to wear herself out at night, working beyond her strength when\r\nthe rest were asleep, so as to get the wet linen hung on a line and dry\r\nby the morning. She took up the basin of water at Raskolnikov\xe2\x80\x99s request,\r\nbut almost fell down with her burden. But the latter had already\r\nsucceeded in finding a towel, wetted it and began washing the blood off\r\nMarmeladov\xe2\x80\x99s face.\r\n\r\nKaterina Ivanovna stood by, breathing painfully and pressing her hands\r\nto her breast. She was in need of attention herself. Raskolnikov began\r\nto realise that he might have made a mistake in having the injured man\r\nbrought here. The policeman, too, stood in hesitation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPolenka,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Katerina Ivanovna, \xe2\x80\x9crun to Sonia, make haste. If you\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t find her at home, leave word that her father has been run over\r\nand that she is to come here at once... when she comes in. Run, Polenka!\r\nthere, put on the shawl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRun your fastest!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the little boy on the chair suddenly, after\r\nwhich he relapsed into the same dumb rigidity, with round eyes, his\r\nheels thrust forward and his toes spread out.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the room had become so full of people that you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have\r\ndropped a pin. The policemen left, all except one, who remained for a\r\ntime, trying to drive out the people who came in from the stairs. Almost\r\nall Madame Lippevechsel\xe2\x80\x99s lodgers had streamed in from the inner rooms\r\nof the flat; at first they were squeezed together in the doorway, but\r\nafterwards they overflowed into the room. Katerina Ivanovna flew into a\r\nfury.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou might let him die in peace, at least,\xe2\x80\x9d she shouted at the crowd,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cis it a spectacle for you to gape at? With cigarettes! (Cough, cough,\r\ncough!) You might as well keep your hats on.... And there is one in his\r\nhat!... Get away! You should respect the dead, at least!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer cough choked her--but her reproaches were not without result. They\r\nevidently stood in some awe of Katerina Ivanovna. The lodgers, one after\r\nanother, squeezed back into the doorway with that strange inner feeling\r\nof satisfaction which may be observed in the presence of a sudden\r\naccident, even in those nearest and dearest to the victim, from which\r\nno living man is exempt, even in spite of the sincerest sympathy and\r\ncompassion.\r\n\r\nVoices outside were heard, however, speaking of the hospital and saying\r\nthat they\xe2\x80\x99d no business to make a disturbance here.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo business to die!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Katerina Ivanovna, and she was rushing to\r\nthe door to vent her wrath upon them, but in the doorway came face to\r\nface with Madame Lippevechsel who had only just heard of the accident\r\nand ran in to restore order. She was a particularly quarrelsome and\r\nirresponsible German.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, my God!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, clasping her hands, \xe2\x80\x9cyour husband drunken\r\nhorses have trampled! To the hospital with him! I am the landlady!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAmalia Ludwigovna, I beg you to recollect what you are saying,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Katerina Ivanovna began haughtily (she always took a haughty tone with\r\nthe landlady that she might \xe2\x80\x9cremember her place\xe2\x80\x9d and even now could not\r\ndeny herself this satisfaction). \xe2\x80\x9cAmalia Ludwigovna...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have you once before told that you to call me Amalia Ludwigovna may\r\nnot dare; I am Amalia Ivanovna.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are not Amalia Ivanovna, but Amalia Ludwigovna, and as I am not\r\none of your despicable flatterers like Mr. Lebeziatnikov, who\xe2\x80\x99s laughing\r\nbehind the door at this moment (a laugh and a cry of \xe2\x80\x98they are at it\r\nagain\xe2\x80\x99 was in fact audible at the door) so I shall always call you\r\nAmalia Ludwigovna, though I fail to understand why you dislike that\r\nname. You can see for yourself what has happened to Semyon Zaharovitch;\r\nhe is dying. I beg you to close that door at once and to admit no one.\r\nLet him at least die in peace! Or I warn you the Governor-General,\r\nhimself, shall be informed of your conduct to-morrow. The prince knew\r\nme as a girl; he remembers Semyon Zaharovitch well and has often been\r\na benefactor to him. Everyone knows that Semyon Zaharovitch had many\r\nfriends and protectors, whom he abandoned himself from an honourable\r\npride, knowing his unhappy weakness, but now (she pointed to\r\nRaskolnikov) a generous young man has come to our assistance, who has\r\nwealth and connections and whom Semyon Zaharovitch has known from a\r\nchild. You may rest assured, Amalia Ludwigovna...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll this was uttered with extreme rapidity, getting quicker and quicker,\r\nbut a cough suddenly cut short Katerina Ivanovna\xe2\x80\x99s eloquence. At that\r\ninstant the dying man recovered consciousness and uttered a groan; she\r\nran to him. The injured man opened his eyes and without recognition or\r\nunderstanding gazed at Raskolnikov who was bending over him. He drew\r\ndeep, slow, painful breaths; blood oozed at the corners of his mouth\r\nand drops of perspiration came out on his forehead. Not recognising\r\nRaskolnikov, he began looking round uneasily. Katerina Ivanovna looked\r\nat him with a sad but stern face, and tears trickled from her eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy God! His whole chest is crushed! How he is bleeding,\xe2\x80\x9d she said\r\nin despair. \xe2\x80\x9cWe must take off his clothes. Turn a little, Semyon\r\nZaharovitch, if you can,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried to him.\r\n\r\nMarmeladov recognised her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA priest,\xe2\x80\x9d he articulated huskily.\r\n\r\nKaterina Ivanovna walked to the window, laid her head against the window\r\nframe and exclaimed in despair:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, cursed life!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA priest,\xe2\x80\x9d the dying man said again after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ve gone for him,\xe2\x80\x9d Katerina Ivanovna shouted to him, he obeyed her\r\nshout and was silent. With sad and timid eyes he looked for her; she\r\nreturned and stood by his pillow. He seemed a little easier but not for\r\nlong.\r\n\r\nSoon his eyes rested on little Lida, his favourite, who was shaking in\r\nthe corner, as though she were in a fit, and staring at him with her\r\nwondering childish eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA-ah,\xe2\x80\x9d he signed towards her uneasily. He wanted to say something.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat now?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Katerina Ivanovna.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBarefoot, barefoot!\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered, indicating with frenzied eyes the\r\nchild\xe2\x80\x99s bare feet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe silent,\xe2\x80\x9d Katerina Ivanovna cried irritably, \xe2\x80\x9cyou know why she is\r\nbarefooted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank God, the doctor,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Raskolnikov, relieved.\r\n\r\nThe doctor came in, a precise little old man, a German, looking about\r\nhim mistrustfully; he went up to the sick man, took his pulse, carefully\r\nfelt his head and with the help of Katerina Ivanovna he unbuttoned the\r\nblood-stained shirt, and bared the injured man\xe2\x80\x99s chest. It was gashed,\r\ncrushed and fractured, several ribs on the right side were broken.\r\nOn the left side, just over the heart, was a large, sinister-looking\r\nyellowish-black bruise--a cruel kick from the horse\xe2\x80\x99s hoof. The doctor\r\nfrowned. The policeman told him that he was caught in the wheel and\r\nturned round with it for thirty yards on the road.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s wonderful that he has recovered consciousness,\xe2\x80\x9d the doctor\r\nwhispered softly to Raskolnikov.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think of him?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe will die immediately.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there really no hope?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot the faintest! He is at the last gasp.... His head is badly injured,\r\ntoo... Hm... I could bleed him if you like, but... it would be useless.\r\nHe is bound to die within the next five or ten minutes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetter bleed him then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you like.... But I warn you it will be perfectly useless.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt that moment other steps were heard; the crowd in the passage parted,\r\nand the priest, a little, grey old man, appeared in the doorway bearing\r\nthe sacrament. A policeman had gone for him at the time of the accident.\r\nThe doctor changed places with him, exchanging glances with him.\r\nRaskolnikov begged the doctor to remain a little while. He shrugged his\r\nshoulders and remained.\r\n\r\nAll stepped back. The confession was soon over. The dying man probably\r\nunderstood little; he could only utter indistinct broken sounds.\r\nKaterina Ivanovna took little Lida, lifted the boy from the chair, knelt\r\ndown in the corner by the stove and made the children kneel in front of\r\nher. The little girl was still trembling; but the boy, kneeling on his\r\nlittle bare knees, lifted his hand rhythmically, crossing himself with\r\nprecision and bowed down, touching the floor with his forehead, which\r\nseemed to afford him especial satisfaction. Katerina Ivanovna bit her\r\nlips and held back her tears; she prayed, too, now and then pulling\r\nstraight the boy\xe2\x80\x99s shirt, and managed to cover the girl\xe2\x80\x99s bare shoulders\r\nwith a kerchief, which she took from the chest without rising from her\r\nknees or ceasing to pray. Meanwhile the door from the inner rooms was\r\nopened inquisitively again. In the passage the crowd of spectators from\r\nall the flats on the staircase grew denser and denser, but they did not\r\nventure beyond the threshold. A single candle-end lighted up the scene.\r\n\r\nAt that moment Polenka forced her way through the crowd at the door. She\r\ncame in panting from running so fast, took off her kerchief, looked for\r\nher mother, went up to her and said, \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s coming, I met her in the\r\nstreet.\xe2\x80\x9d Her mother made her kneel beside her.\r\n\r\nTimidly and noiselessly a young girl made her way through the crowd,\r\nand strange was her appearance in that room, in the midst of want, rags,\r\ndeath and despair. She, too, was in rags, her attire was all of\r\nthe cheapest, but decked out in gutter finery of a special stamp,\r\nunmistakably betraying its shameful purpose. Sonia stopped short in the\r\ndoorway and looked about her bewildered, unconscious of everything.\r\nShe forgot her fourth-hand, gaudy silk dress, so unseemly here with\r\nits ridiculous long train, and her immense crinoline that filled up the\r\nwhole doorway, and her light-coloured shoes, and the parasol she brought\r\nwith her, though it was no use at night, and the absurd round straw hat\r\nwith its flaring flame-coloured feather. Under this rakishly-tilted hat\r\nwas a pale, frightened little face with lips parted and eyes staring in\r\nterror. Sonia was a small thin girl of eighteen with fair hair, rather\r\npretty, with wonderful blue eyes. She looked intently at the bed and the\r\npriest; she too was out of breath with running. At last whispers, some\r\nwords in the crowd probably, reached her. She looked down and took a\r\nstep forward into the room, still keeping close to the door.\r\n\r\nThe service was over. Katerina Ivanovna went up to her husband again.\r\nThe priest stepped back and turned to say a few words of admonition and\r\nconsolation to Katerina Ivanovna on leaving.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat am I to do with these?\xe2\x80\x9d she interrupted sharply and irritably,\r\npointing to the little ones.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod is merciful; look to the Most High for succour,\xe2\x80\x9d the priest began.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAch! He is merciful, but not to us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a sin, a sin, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d observed the priest, shaking his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd isn\xe2\x80\x99t that a sin?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Katerina Ivanovna, pointing to the dying\r\nman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps those who have involuntarily caused the accident will agree to\r\ncompensate you, at least for the loss of his earnings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t understand!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Katerina Ivanovna angrily waving her hand.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd why should they compensate me? Why, he was drunk and threw himself\r\nunder the horses! What earnings? He brought us in nothing but misery.\r\nHe drank everything away, the drunkard! He robbed us to get drink, he\r\nwasted their lives and mine for drink! And thank God he\xe2\x80\x99s dying! One\r\nless to keep!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must forgive in the hour of death, that\xe2\x80\x99s a sin, madam, such\r\nfeelings are a great sin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKaterina Ivanovna was busy with the dying man; she was giving him water,\r\nwiping the blood and sweat from his head, setting his pillow straight,\r\nand had only turned now and then for a moment to address the priest. Now\r\nshe flew at him almost in a frenzy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, father! That\xe2\x80\x99s words and only words! Forgive! If he\xe2\x80\x99d not been run\r\nover, he\xe2\x80\x99d have come home to-day drunk and his only shirt dirty and\r\nin rags and he\xe2\x80\x99d have fallen asleep like a log, and I should have been\r\nsousing and rinsing till daybreak, washing his rags and the children\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nand then drying them by the window and as soon as it was daylight I\r\nshould have been darning them. That\xe2\x80\x99s how I spend my nights!... What\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe use of talking of forgiveness! I have forgiven as it is!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA terrible hollow cough interrupted her words. She put her handkerchief\r\nto her lips and showed it to the priest, pressing her other hand to her\r\naching chest. The handkerchief was covered with blood. The priest bowed\r\nhis head and said nothing.\r\n\r\nMarmeladov was in the last agony; he did not take his eyes off the face\r\nof Katerina Ivanovna, who was bending over him again. He kept trying\r\nto say something to her; he began moving his tongue with difficulty and\r\narticulating indistinctly, but Katerina Ivanovna, understanding that he\r\nwanted to ask her forgiveness, called peremptorily to him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe silent! No need! I know what you want to say!\xe2\x80\x9d And the sick man\r\nwas silent, but at the same instant his wandering eyes strayed to the\r\ndoorway and he saw Sonia.\r\n\r\nTill then he had not noticed her: she was standing in the shadow in a\r\ncorner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s that? Who\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d he said suddenly in a thick gasping voice,\r\nin agitation, turning his eyes in horror towards the door where his\r\ndaughter was standing, and trying to sit up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLie down! Lie do-own!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Katerina Ivanovna.\r\n\r\nWith unnatural strength he had succeeded in propping himself on his\r\nelbow. He looked wildly and fixedly for some time on his daughter, as\r\nthough not recognising her. He had never seen her before in such attire.\r\nSuddenly he recognised her, crushed and ashamed in her humiliation and\r\ngaudy finery, meekly awaiting her turn to say good-bye to her dying\r\nfather. His face showed intense suffering.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSonia! Daughter! Forgive!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, and he tried to hold out his hand\r\nto her, but losing his balance, he fell off the sofa, face downwards on\r\nthe floor. They rushed to pick him up, they put him on the sofa; but he\r\nwas dying. Sonia with a faint cry ran up, embraced him and remained so\r\nwithout moving. He died in her arms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s got what he wanted,\xe2\x80\x9d Katerina Ivanovna cried, seeing her husband\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndead body. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, what\xe2\x80\x99s to be done now? How am I to bury him! What can\r\nI give them to-morrow to eat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRaskolnikov went up to Katerina Ivanovna.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKaterina Ivanovna,\xe2\x80\x9d he began, \xe2\x80\x9clast week your husband told me all his\r\nlife and circumstances.... Believe me, he spoke of you with passionate\r\nreverence. From that evening, when I learnt how devoted he was to you\r\nall and how he loved and respected you especially, Katerina Ivanovna,\r\nin spite of his unfortunate weakness, from that evening we became\r\nfriends.... Allow me now... to do something... to repay my debt to my\r\ndead friend. Here are twenty roubles, I think--and if that can be of any\r\nassistance to you, then... I... in short, I will come again, I will\r\nbe sure to come again... I shall, perhaps, come again to-morrow....\r\nGood-bye!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he went quickly out of the room, squeezing his way through the crowd\r\nto the stairs. But in the crowd he suddenly jostled against Nikodim\r\nFomitch, who had heard of the accident and had come to give instructions\r\nin person. They had not met since the scene at the police station, but\r\nNikodim Fomitch knew him instantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, is that you?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s dead,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Raskolnikov. \xe2\x80\x9cThe doctor and the priest have been,\r\nall as it should have been. Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry the poor woman too much, she is\r\nin consumption as it is. Try and cheer her up, if possible... you are a\r\nkind-hearted man, I know...\xe2\x80\x9d he added with a smile, looking straight in\r\nhis face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you are spattered with blood,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Nikodim Fomitch, noticing\r\nin the lamplight some fresh stains on Raskolnikov\xe2\x80\x99s waistcoat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes... I\xe2\x80\x99m covered with blood,\xe2\x80\x9d Raskolnikov said with a peculiar air;\r\nthen he smiled, nodded and went downstairs.\r\n\r\nHe walked down slowly and deliberately, feverish but not conscious\r\nof it, entirely absorbed in a new overwhelming sensation of life and\r\nstrength that surged up suddenly within him. This sensation might be\r\ncompared to that of a man condemned to death who has suddenly been\r\npardoned. Halfway down the staircase he was overtaken by the priest on\r\nhis way home; Raskolnikov let him pass, exchanging a silent greeting\r\nwith him. He was just descending the last steps when he heard rapid\r\nfootsteps behind him. Someone overtook him; it was Polenka. She was\r\nrunning after him, calling \xe2\x80\x9cWait! wait!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe turned round. She was at the bottom of the staircase and stopped\r\nshort a step above him. A dim light came in from the yard. Raskolnikov\r\ncould distinguish the child\xe2\x80\x99s thin but pretty little face, looking at\r\nhim with a bright childish smile. She had run after him with a message\r\nwhich she was evidently glad to give.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me, what is your name?... and where do you live?\xe2\x80\x9d she said\r\nhurriedly in a breathless voice.\r\n\r\nHe laid both hands on her shoulders and looked at her with a sort of\r\nrapture. It was such a joy to him to look at her, he could not have said\r\nwhy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho sent you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSister Sonia sent me,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the girl, smiling still more brightly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew it was sister Sonia sent you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMamma sent me, too... when sister Sonia was sending me, mamma came up,\r\ntoo, and said \xe2\x80\x98Run fast, Polenka.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you love sister Sonia?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI love her more than anyone,\xe2\x80\x9d Polenka answered with a peculiar\r\nearnestness, and her smile became graver.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd will you love me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy way of answer he saw the little girl\xe2\x80\x99s face approaching him, her full\r\nlips na\xc3\xafvely held out to kiss him. Suddenly her arms as thin as sticks\r\nheld him tightly, her head rested on his shoulder and the little girl\r\nwept softly, pressing her face against him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry for father,\xe2\x80\x9d she said a moment later, raising her\r\ntear-stained face and brushing away the tears with her hands. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnothing but misfortunes now,\xe2\x80\x9d she added suddenly with that peculiarly\r\nsedate air which children try hard to assume when they want to speak\r\nlike grown-up people.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid your father love you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe loved Lida most,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on very seriously without a smile,\r\nexactly like grown-up people, \xe2\x80\x9che loved her because she is little and\r\nbecause she is ill, too. And he always used to bring her presents. But\r\nhe taught us to read and me grammar and scripture, too,\xe2\x80\x9d she added with\r\ndignity. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd mother never used to say anything, but we knew that she\r\nliked it and father knew it, too. And mother wants to teach me French,\r\nfor it\xe2\x80\x99s time my education began.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd do you know your prayers?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, we do! We knew them long ago. I say my prayers to myself\r\nas I am a big girl now, but Kolya and Lida say them aloud with mother.\r\nFirst they repeat the \xe2\x80\x98Ave Maria\xe2\x80\x99 and then another prayer: \xe2\x80\x98Lord,\r\nforgive and bless sister Sonia,\xe2\x80\x99 and then another, \xe2\x80\x98Lord, forgive and\r\nbless our second father.\xe2\x80\x99 For our elder father is dead and this is\r\nanother one, but we do pray for the other as well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPolenka, my name is Rodion. Pray sometimes for me, too. \xe2\x80\x98And Thy\r\nservant Rodion,\xe2\x80\x99 nothing more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll pray for you all the rest of my life,\xe2\x80\x9d the little girl declared\r\nhotly, and suddenly smiling again she rushed at him and hugged him\r\nwarmly once more.\r\n\r\nRaskolnikov told her his name and address and promised to be sure to\r\ncome next day. The child went away quite enchanted with him. It was past\r\nten when he came out into the street. In five minutes he was standing on\r\nthe bridge at the spot where the woman had jumped in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEnough,\xe2\x80\x9d he pronounced resolutely and triumphantly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve done with\r\nfancies, imaginary terrors and phantoms! Life is real! haven\xe2\x80\x99t I lived\r\njust now? My life has not yet died with that old woman! The Kingdom of\r\nHeaven to her--and now enough, madam, leave me in peace! Now for the\r\nreign of reason and light... and of will, and of strength... and now\r\nwe will see! We will try our strength!\xe2\x80\x9d he added defiantly, as though\r\nchallenging some power of darkness. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I was ready to consent to live\r\nin a square of space!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am very weak at this moment, but... I believe my illness is all over.\r\nI knew it would be over when I went out. By the way, Potchinkov\xe2\x80\x99s house\r\nis only a few steps away. I certainly must go to Razumihin even if\r\nit were not close by... let him win his bet! Let us give him some\r\nsatisfaction, too--no matter! Strength, strength is what one wants, you\r\ncan get nothing without it, and strength must be won by strength--that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwhat they don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d he added proudly and self-confidently and\r\nhe walked with flagging footsteps from the bridge. Pride and\r\nself-confidence grew continually stronger in him; he was becoming\r\na different man every moment. What was it had happened to work this\r\nrevolution in him? He did not know himself; like a man catching at a\r\nstraw, he suddenly felt that he, too, \xe2\x80\x98could live, that there was still\r\nlife for him, that his life had not died with the old woman.\xe2\x80\x99 Perhaps he\r\nwas in too great a hurry with his conclusions, but he did not think of\r\nthat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I did ask her to remember \xe2\x80\x98Thy servant Rodion\xe2\x80\x99 in her prayers,\xe2\x80\x9d the\r\nidea struck him. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, that was... in case of emergency,\xe2\x80\x9d he added and\r\nlaughed himself at his boyish sally. He was in the best of spirits.\r\n\r\nHe easily found Razumihin; the new lodger was already known at\r\nPotchinkov\xe2\x80\x99s and the porter at once showed him the way. Half-way\r\nupstairs he could hear the noise and animated conversation of a big\r\ngathering of people. The door was wide open on the stairs; he could\r\nhear exclamations and discussion. Razumihin\xe2\x80\x99s room was fairly large; the\r\ncompany consisted of fifteen people. Raskolnikov stopped in the entry,\r\nwhere two of the landlady\xe2\x80\x99s servants were busy behind a screen with two\r\nsamovars, bottles, plates and dishes of pie and savouries, brought up\r\nfrom the landlady\xe2\x80\x99s kitchen. Raskolnikov sent in for Razumihin. He ran\r\nout delighted. At the first glance it was apparent that he had had a\r\ngreat deal to drink and, though no amount of liquor made Razumihin quite\r\ndrunk, this time he was perceptibly affected by it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen,\xe2\x80\x9d Raskolnikov hastened to say, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve only just come to tell you\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve won your bet and that no one really knows what may not happen to\r\nhim. I can\xe2\x80\x99t come in; I am so weak that I shall fall down directly. And\r\nso good evening and good-bye! Come and see me to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know what? I\xe2\x80\x99ll see you home. If you say you\xe2\x80\x99re weak yourself,\r\nyou must...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd your visitors? Who is the curly-headed one who has just peeped\r\nout?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe? Goodness only knows! Some friend of uncle\xe2\x80\x99s, I expect, or perhaps\r\nhe has come without being invited... I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave uncle with them, he\r\nis an invaluable person, pity I can\xe2\x80\x99t introduce you to him now. But\r\nconfound them all now! They won\xe2\x80\x99t notice me, and I need a little fresh\r\nair, for you\xe2\x80\x99ve come just in the nick of time--another two minutes and I\r\nshould have come to blows! They are talking such a lot of wild stuff...\r\nyou simply can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine what men will say! Though why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nimagine? Don\xe2\x80\x99t we talk nonsense ourselves? And let them... that\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nway to learn not to!... Wait a minute, I\xe2\x80\x99ll fetch Zossimov.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nZossimov pounced upon Raskolnikov almost greedily; he showed a special\r\ninterest in him; soon his face brightened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must go to bed at once,\xe2\x80\x9d he pronounced, examining the patient as\r\nfar as he could, \xe2\x80\x9cand take something for the night. Will you take it? I\r\ngot it ready some time ago... a powder.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo, if you like,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Raskolnikov. The powder was taken at once.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing you are taking him home,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Zossimov to\r\nRazumihin--\xe2\x80\x9cwe shall see how he is to-morrow, to-day he\xe2\x80\x99s not at all\r\namiss--a considerable change since the afternoon. Live and learn...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know what Zossimov whispered to me when we were coming out?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Razumihin blurted out, as soon as they were in the street. \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t tell\r\nyou everything, brother, because they are such fools. Zossimov told me\r\nto talk freely to you on the way and get you to talk freely to me, and\r\nafterwards I am to tell him about it, for he\xe2\x80\x99s got a notion in his head\r\nthat you are... mad or close on it. Only fancy! In the first place,\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve three times the brains he has; in the second, if you are not mad,\r\nyou needn\xe2\x80\x99t care a hang that he has got such a wild idea; and thirdly,\r\nthat piece of beef whose specialty is surgery has gone mad on mental\r\ndiseases, and what\xe2\x80\x99s brought him to this conclusion about you was your\r\nconversation to-day with Zametov.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cZametov told you all about it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and he did well. Now I understand what it all means and so does\r\nZametov.... Well, the fact is, Rodya... the point is... I am a little\r\ndrunk now.... But that\xe2\x80\x99s... no matter... the point is that this\r\nidea... you understand? was just being hatched in their brains... you\r\nunderstand? That is, no one ventured to say it aloud, because the idea\r\nis too absurd and especially since the arrest of that painter, that\r\nbubble\xe2\x80\x99s burst and gone for ever. But why are they such fools? I gave\r\nZametov a bit of a thrashing at the time--that\xe2\x80\x99s between ourselves,\r\nbrother; please don\xe2\x80\x99t let out a hint that you know of it; I\xe2\x80\x99ve noticed\r\nhe is a ticklish subject; it was at Luise Ivanovna\xe2\x80\x99s. But to-day, to-day\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s all cleared up. That Ilya Petrovitch is at the bottom of it! He\r\ntook advantage of your fainting at the police station, but he is ashamed\r\nof it himself now; I know that...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRaskolnikov listened greedily. Razumihin was drunk enough to talk too\r\nfreely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI fainted then because it was so close and the smell of paint,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nRaskolnikov.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo need to explain that! And it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the paint only: the fever had\r\nbeen coming on for a month; Zossimov testifies to that! But how crushed\r\nthat boy is now, you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t believe! \xe2\x80\x98I am not worth his little\r\nfinger,\xe2\x80\x99 he says. Yours, he means. He has good feelings at times,\r\nbrother. But the lesson, the lesson you gave him to-day in the Palais\r\nde Cristal, that was too good for anything! You frightened him at first,\r\nyou know, he nearly went into convulsions! You almost convinced\r\nhim again of the truth of all that hideous nonsense, and then you\r\nsuddenly--put out your tongue at him: \xe2\x80\x98There now, what do you make of\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x99 It was perfect! He is crushed, annihilated now! It was masterly, by\r\nJove, it\xe2\x80\x99s what they deserve! Ah, that I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t there! He was hoping to\r\nsee you awfully. Porfiry, too, wants to make your acquaintance...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!... he too... but why did they put me down as mad?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, not mad. I must have said too much, brother.... What struck him,\r\nyou see, was that only that subject seemed to interest you; now it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nclear why it did interest you; knowing all the circumstances... and\r\nhow that irritated you and worked in with your illness... I am a little\r\ndrunk, brother, only, confound him, he has some idea of his own... I\r\ntell you, he\xe2\x80\x99s mad on mental diseases. But don\xe2\x80\x99t you mind him...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor half a minute both were silent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen, Razumihin,\xe2\x80\x9d began Raskolnikov, \xe2\x80\x9cI want to tell you plainly:\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve just been at a death-bed, a clerk who died... I gave them all my\r\nmoney... and besides I\xe2\x80\x99ve just been kissed by someone who, if I had\r\nkilled anyone, would just the same... in fact I saw someone else\r\nthere... with a flame-coloured feather... but I am talking nonsense; I\r\nam very weak, support me... we shall be at the stairs directly...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter? What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with you?\xe2\x80\x9d Razumihin asked\r\nanxiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am a little giddy, but that\xe2\x80\x99s not the point, I am so sad, so sad...\r\nlike a woman. Look, what\xe2\x80\x99s that? Look, look!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you see? A light in my room, you see? Through the crack...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were already at the foot of the last flight of stairs, at the level\r\nof the landlady\xe2\x80\x99s door, and they could, as a fact, see from below that\r\nthere was a light in Raskolnikov\xe2\x80\x99s garret.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQueer! Nastasya, perhaps,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Razumihin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is never in my room at this time and she must be in bed long ago,\r\nbut... I don\xe2\x80\x99t care! Good-bye!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean? I am coming with you, we\xe2\x80\x99ll come in together!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know we are going in together, but I want to shake hands here and say\r\ngood-bye to you here. So give me your hand, good-bye!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with you, Rodya?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing... come along... you shall be witness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey began mounting the stairs, and the idea struck Razumihin that\r\nperhaps Zossimov might be right after all. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, I\xe2\x80\x99ve upset him with my\r\nchatter!\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered to himself.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached the door they heard voices in the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Razumihin. Raskolnikov was the first to open the\r\ndoor; he flung it wide and stood still in the doorway, dumbfoundered.\r\n\r\nHis mother and sister were sitting on his sofa and had been waiting an\r\nhour and a half for him. Why had he never expected, never thought of\r\nthem, though the news that they had started, were on their way and would\r\narrive immediately, had been repeated to him only that day? They had\r\nspent that hour and a half plying Nastasya with questions. She was\r\nstanding before them and had told them everything by now. They were\r\nbeside themselves with alarm when they heard of his \xe2\x80\x9crunning away\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n to-day, ill and, as they understood from her story, delirious! \xe2\x80\x9cGood\r\nHeavens, what had become of him?\xe2\x80\x9d Both had been weeping, both had been\r\nin anguish for that hour and a half.\r\n\r\nA cry of joy, of ecstasy, greeted Raskolnikov\xe2\x80\x99s entrance. Both rushed to\r\nhim. But he stood like one dead; a sudden intolerable sensation struck\r\nhim like a thunderbolt. He did not lift his arms to embrace them, he\r\ncould not. His mother and sister clasped him in their arms, kissed him,\r\nlaughed and cried. He took a step, tottered and fell to the ground,\r\nfainting.\r\n\r\nAnxiety, cries of horror, moans... Razumihin who was standing in the\r\ndoorway flew into the room, seized the sick man in his strong arms and\r\nin a moment had him on the sofa.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s nothing, nothing!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried to the mother and sister--\xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s only a\r\nfaint, a mere trifle! Only just now the doctor said he was much better,\r\nthat he is perfectly well! Water! See, he is coming to himself, he is\r\nall right again!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd seizing Dounia by the arm so that he almost dislocated it, he made\r\nher bend down to see that \xe2\x80\x9che is all right again.\xe2\x80\x9d The mother and sister\r\nlooked on him with emotion and gratitude, as their Providence. They\r\nhad heard already from Nastasya all that had been done for their Rodya\r\nduring his illness, by this \xe2\x80\x9cvery competent young man,\xe2\x80\x9d as Pulcheria\r\nAlexandrovna Raskolnikov called him that evening in conversation with\r\nDounia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nRaskolnikov got up, and sat down on the sofa. He waved his hand weakly\r\nto Razumihin to cut short the flow of warm and incoherent consolations\r\nhe was addressing to his mother and sister, took them both by the hand\r\nand for a minute or two gazed from one to the other without speaking.\r\nHis mother was alarmed by his expression. It revealed an emotion\r\nagonisingly poignant, and at the same time something immovable, almost\r\ninsane. Pulcheria Alexandrovna began to cry.\r\n\r\nAvdotya Romanovna was pale; her hand trembled in her brother\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo home... with him,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in a broken voice, pointing to Razumihin,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cgood-bye till to-morrow; to-morrow everything... Is it long since you\r\narrived?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis evening, Rodya,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Pulcheria Alexandrovna, \xe2\x80\x9cthe train was\r\nawfully late. But, Rodya, nothing would induce me to leave you now! I\r\nwill spend the night here, near you...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t torture me!\xe2\x80\x9d he said with a gesture of irritation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will stay with him,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Razumihin, \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t leave him for a\r\nmoment. Bother all my visitors! Let them rage to their hearts\xe2\x80\x99 content!\r\nMy uncle is presiding there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow, how can I thank you!\xe2\x80\x9d Pulcheria Alexandrovna was beginning, once\r\nmore pressing Razumihin\xe2\x80\x99s hands, but Raskolnikov interrupted her again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t have it! I can\xe2\x80\x99t have it!\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated irritably, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t worry\r\nme! Enough, go away... I can\xe2\x80\x99t stand it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, mamma, come out of the room at least for a minute,\xe2\x80\x9d Dounia\r\nwhispered in dismay; \xe2\x80\x9cwe are distressing him, that\xe2\x80\x99s evident.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMayn\xe2\x80\x99t I look at him after three years?\xe2\x80\x9d wept Pulcheria Alexandrovna.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStay,\xe2\x80\x9d he stopped them again, \xe2\x80\x9cyou keep interrupting me, and my ideas\r\nget muddled.... Have you seen Luzhin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Rodya, but he knows already of our arrival. We have heard, Rodya,\r\nthat Pyotr Petrovitch was so kind as to visit you today,\xe2\x80\x9d Pulcheria\r\nAlexandrovna added somewhat timidly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes... he was so kind... Dounia, I promised Luzhin I\xe2\x80\x99d throw him\r\ndownstairs and told him to go to hell....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRodya, what are you saying! Surely, you don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to tell us...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Pulcheria Alexandrovna began in alarm, but she stopped, looking at\r\nDounia.\r\n\r\nAvdotya Romanovna was looking attentively at her brother, waiting\r\nfor what would come next. Both of them had heard of the quarrel from\r\nNastasya, so far as she had succeeded in understanding and reporting it,\r\nand were in painful perplexity and suspense.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDounia,\xe2\x80\x9d Raskolnikov continued with an effort, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want that\r\nmarriage, so at the first opportunity to-morrow you must refuse Luzhin,\r\nso that we may never hear his name again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood Heavens!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBrother, think what you are saying!\xe2\x80\x9d Avdotya Romanovna began\r\nimpetuously, but immediately checked herself. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are not fit to talk\r\nnow, perhaps; you are tired,\xe2\x80\x9d she added gently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou think I am delirious? No... You are marrying Luzhin for _my_\r\nsake. But I won\xe2\x80\x99t accept the sacrifice. And so write a letter before\r\nto-morrow, to refuse him... Let me read it in the morning and that will\r\nbe the end of it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I can\xe2\x80\x99t do!\xe2\x80\x9d the girl cried, offended, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat right have you...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDounia, you are hasty, too, be quiet, to-morrow... Don\xe2\x80\x99t you see...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n the mother interposed in dismay. \xe2\x80\x9cBetter come away!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is raving,\xe2\x80\x9d Razumihin cried tipsily, \xe2\x80\x9cor how would he dare!\r\nTo-morrow all this nonsense will be over... to-day he certainly did\r\ndrive him away. That was so. And Luzhin got angry, too.... He made\r\nspeeches here, wanted to show off his learning and he went out\r\ncrest-fallen....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen it\xe2\x80\x99s true?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye till to-morrow, brother,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dounia compassionately--\xe2\x80\x9clet us\r\ngo, mother... Good-bye, Rodya.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you hear, sister,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated after them, making a last effort,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not delirious; this marriage is--an infamy. Let me act like\r\na scoundrel, but you mustn\xe2\x80\x99t... one is enough... and though I am a\r\nscoundrel, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t own such a sister. It\xe2\x80\x99s me or Luzhin! Go now....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you\xe2\x80\x99re out of your mind! Despot!\xe2\x80\x9d roared Razumihin; but Raskolnikov\r\ndid not and perhaps could not answer. He lay down on the sofa, and\r\nturned to the wall, utterly exhausted. Avdotya Romanovna looked with\r\ninterest at Razumihin; her black eyes flashed; Razumihin positively\r\nstarted at her glance.\r\n\r\nPulcheria Alexandrovna stood overwhelmed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing would induce me to go,\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered in despair to Razumihin.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will stay somewhere here... escort Dounia home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll spoil everything,\xe2\x80\x9d Razumihin answered in the same whisper,\r\nlosing patience--\xe2\x80\x9ccome out on to the stairs, anyway. Nastasya, show a\r\nlight! I assure you,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on in a half whisper on the stairs--\xe2\x80\x9cthat\r\nhe was almost beating the doctor and me this afternoon! Do you\r\nunderstand? The doctor himself! Even he gave way and left him, so as not\r\nto irritate him. I remained downstairs on guard, but he dressed at once\r\nand slipped off. And he will slip off again if you irritate him, at this\r\ntime of night, and will do himself some mischief....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you saying?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Avdotya Romanovna can\xe2\x80\x99t possibly be left in those lodgings without\r\nyou. Just think where you are staying! That blackguard Pyotr Petrovitch\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t find you better lodgings... But you know I\xe2\x80\x99ve had a little to\r\ndrink, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what makes me... swear; don\xe2\x80\x99t mind it....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I\xe2\x80\x99ll go to the landlady here,\xe2\x80\x9d Pulcheria Alexandrovna insisted,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll beseech her to find some corner for Dounia and me for the night. I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t leave him like that, I cannot!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis conversation took place on the landing just before the landlady\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndoor. Nastasya lighted them from a step below. Razumihin was in\r\nextraordinary excitement. Half an hour earlier, while he was bringing\r\nRaskolnikov home, he had indeed talked too freely, but he was aware of\r\nit himself, and his head was clear in spite of the vast quantities he\r\nhad imbibed. Now he was in a state bordering on ecstasy, and all that he\r\nhad drunk seemed to fly to his head with redoubled effect. He stood with\r\nthe two ladies, seizing both by their hands, persuading them, and giving\r\nthem reasons with astonishing plainness of speech, and at almost every\r\nword he uttered, probably to emphasise his arguments, he squeezed their\r\nhands painfully as in a vise. He stared at Avdotya Romanovna without the\r\nleast regard for good manners. They sometimes pulled their hands out of\r\nhis huge bony paws, but far from noticing what was the matter, he drew\r\nthem all the closer to him. If they\xe2\x80\x99d told him to jump head foremost\r\nfrom the staircase, he would have done it without thought or hesitation\r\nin their service. Though Pulcheria Alexandrovna felt that the young man\r\nwas really too eccentric and pinched her hand too much, in her anxiety\r\nover her Rodya she looked on his presence as providential, and was\r\nunwilling to notice all his peculiarities. But though Avdotya Romanovna\r\nshared her anxiety, and was not of timorous disposition, she could not\r\nsee the glowing light in his eyes without wonder and almost alarm. It\r\nwas only the unbounded confidence inspired by Nastasya\xe2\x80\x99s account of her\r\nbrother\xe2\x80\x99s queer friend, which prevented her from trying to run away from\r\nhim, and to persuade her mother to do the same. She realised, too,\r\nthat even running away was perhaps impossible now. Ten minutes later,\r\nhowever, she was considerably reassured; it was characteristic of\r\nRazumihin that he showed his true nature at once, whatever mood he might\r\nbe in, so that people quickly saw the sort of man they had to deal with.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t go to the landlady, that\xe2\x80\x99s perfect nonsense!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. \xe2\x80\x9cIf\r\nyou stay, though you are his mother, you\xe2\x80\x99ll drive him to a frenzy, and\r\nthen goodness knows what will happen! Listen, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ndo: Nastasya will stay with him now, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll conduct you both home, you\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t be in the streets alone; Petersburg is an awful place in that\r\nway.... But no matter! Then I\xe2\x80\x99ll run straight back here and a quarter of\r\nan hour later, on my word of honour, I\xe2\x80\x99ll bring you news how he is,\r\nwhether he is asleep, and all that. Then, listen! Then I\xe2\x80\x99ll run home in\r\na twinkling--I\xe2\x80\x99ve a lot of friends there, all drunk--I\xe2\x80\x99ll fetch\r\nZossimov--that\xe2\x80\x99s the doctor who is looking after him, he is there, too,\r\nbut he is not drunk; he is not drunk, he is never drunk! I\xe2\x80\x99ll drag him\r\nto Rodya, and then to you, so that you\xe2\x80\x99ll get two reports in the\r\nhour--from the doctor, you understand, from the doctor himself, that\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nvery different thing from my account of him! If there\xe2\x80\x99s anything wrong,\r\nI swear I\xe2\x80\x99ll bring you here myself, but, if it\xe2\x80\x99s all right, you go to\r\nbed. And I\xe2\x80\x99ll spend the night here, in the passage, he won\xe2\x80\x99t hear me,\r\nand I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell Zossimov to sleep at the landlady\xe2\x80\x99s, to be at hand. Which\r\nis better for him: you or the doctor? So come home then! But the\r\nlandlady is out of the question; it\xe2\x80\x99s all right for me, but it\xe2\x80\x99s out of\r\nthe question for you: she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t take you, for she\xe2\x80\x99s... for she\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nfool... She\xe2\x80\x99d be jealous on my account of Avdotya Romanovna and of you,\r\ntoo, if you want to know... of Avdotya Romanovna certainly. She is an\r\nabsolutely, absolutely unaccountable character! But I am a fool, too!...\r\nNo matter! Come along! Do you trust me? Come, do you trust me or not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us go, mother,\xe2\x80\x9d said Avdotya Romanovna, \xe2\x80\x9che will certainly do what\r\nhe has promised. He has saved Rodya already, and if the doctor really\r\nwill consent to spend the night here, what could be better?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, you... you... understand me, because you are an angel!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Razumihin cried in ecstasy, \xe2\x80\x9clet us go! Nastasya! Fly upstairs and sit\r\nwith him with a light; I\xe2\x80\x99ll come in a quarter of an hour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThough Pulcheria Alexandrovna was not perfectly convinced, she made no\r\nfurther resistance. Razumihin gave an arm to each and drew them down\r\nthe stairs. He still made her uneasy, as though he was competent and\r\ngood-natured, was he capable of carrying out his promise? He seemed in\r\nsuch a condition....\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, I see you think I am in such a condition!\xe2\x80\x9d Razumihin broke in upon\r\nher thoughts, guessing them, as he strolled along the pavement with huge\r\nsteps, so that the two ladies could hardly keep up with him, a fact he\r\ndid not observe, however. \xe2\x80\x9cNonsense! That is... I am drunk like a fool,\r\nbut that\xe2\x80\x99s not it; I am not drunk from wine. It\xe2\x80\x99s seeing you has turned\r\nmy head... But don\xe2\x80\x99t mind me! Don\xe2\x80\x99t take any notice: I am talking\r\nnonsense, I am not worthy of you.... I am utterly unworthy of you! The\r\nminute I\xe2\x80\x99ve taken you home, I\xe2\x80\x99ll pour a couple of pailfuls of water over\r\nmy head in the gutter here, and then I shall be all right.... If only\r\nyou knew how I love you both! Don\xe2\x80\x99t laugh, and don\xe2\x80\x99t be angry! You may\r\nbe angry with anyone, but not with me! I am his friend, and therefore I\r\nam your friend, too, I want to be... I had a presentiment... Last year\r\nthere was a moment... though it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a presentiment really, for\r\nyou seem to have fallen from heaven. And I expect I shan\xe2\x80\x99t sleep all\r\nnight... Zossimov was afraid a little time ago that he would go mad...\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s why he mustn\xe2\x80\x99t be irritated.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you say?\xe2\x80\x9d cried the mother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid the doctor really say that?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Avdotya Romanovna, alarmed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not so, not a bit of it. He gave him some medicine, a\r\npowder, I saw it, and then your coming here.... Ah! It would have been\r\nbetter if you had come to-morrow. It\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing we went away. And in\r\nan hour Zossimov himself will report to you about everything. He is not\r\ndrunk! And I shan\xe2\x80\x99t be drunk.... And what made me get so tight? Because\r\nthey got me into an argument, damn them! I\xe2\x80\x99ve sworn never to argue! They\r\ntalk such trash! I almost came to blows! I\xe2\x80\x99ve left my uncle to preside.\r\nWould you believe, they insist on complete absence of individualism\r\nand that\xe2\x80\x99s just what they relish! Not to be themselves, to be as unlike\r\nthemselves as they can. That\xe2\x80\x99s what they regard as the highest point of\r\nprogress. If only their nonsense were their own, but as it is...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen!\xe2\x80\x9d Pulcheria Alexandrovna interrupted timidly, but it only added\r\nfuel to the flames.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think?\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Razumihin, louder than ever, \xe2\x80\x9cyou think I\r\nam attacking them for talking nonsense? Not a bit! I like them to talk\r\nnonsense. That\xe2\x80\x99s man\xe2\x80\x99s one privilege over all creation. Through error\r\nyou come to the truth! I am a man because I err! You never reach any\r\ntruth without making fourteen mistakes and very likely a hundred and\r\nfourteen. And a fine thing, too, in its way; but we can\xe2\x80\x99t even make\r\nmistakes on our own account! Talk nonsense, but talk your own nonsense,\r\nand I\xe2\x80\x99ll kiss you for it. To go wrong in one\xe2\x80\x99s own way is better than\r\nto go right in someone else\xe2\x80\x99s. In the first case you are a man, in the\r\nsecond you\xe2\x80\x99re no better than a bird. Truth won\xe2\x80\x99t escape you, but life\r\ncan be cramped. There have been examples. And what are we doing now?\r\nIn science, development, thought, invention, ideals, aims, liberalism,\r\njudgment, experience and everything, everything, everything, we are\r\nstill in the preparatory class at school. We prefer to live on other\r\npeople\xe2\x80\x99s ideas, it\xe2\x80\x99s what we are used to! Am I right, am I right?\xe2\x80\x9d cried\r\nRazumihin, pressing and shaking the two ladies\xe2\x80\x99 hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, mercy, I do not know,\xe2\x80\x9d cried poor Pulcheria Alexandrovna.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes... though I don\xe2\x80\x99t agree with you in everything,\xe2\x80\x9d added Avdotya\r\nRomanovna earnestly and at once uttered a cry, for he squeezed her hand\r\nso painfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you say yes... well after that you... you...\xe2\x80\x9d he cried in\r\na transport, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are a fount of goodness, purity, sense... and\r\nperfection. Give me your hand... you give me yours, too! I want to kiss\r\nyour hands here at once, on my knees...\xe2\x80\x9d and he fell on his knees on the\r\npavement, fortunately at that time deserted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeave off, I entreat you, what are you doing?\xe2\x80\x9d Pulcheria Alexandrovna\r\ncried, greatly distressed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet up, get up!\xe2\x80\x9d said Dounia laughing, though she, too, was upset.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot for anything till you let me kiss your hands! That\xe2\x80\x99s it! Enough! I\r\nget up and we\xe2\x80\x99ll go on! I am a luckless fool, I am unworthy of you and\r\ndrunk... and I am ashamed.... I am not worthy to love you, but to do\r\nhomage to you is the duty of every man who is not a perfect beast! And\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve done homage.... Here are your lodgings, and for that alone Rodya\r\nwas right in driving your Pyotr Petrovitch away.... How dare he! how\r\ndare he put you in such lodgings! It\xe2\x80\x99s a scandal! Do you know the\r\nsort of people they take in here? And you his betrothed! You are\r\nhis betrothed? Yes? Well, then, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you, your _fianc\xc3\xa9_ is a\r\nscoundrel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcuse me, Mr. Razumihin, you are forgetting...\xe2\x80\x9d Pulcheria Alexandrovna\r\nwas beginning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, you are right, I did forget myself, I am ashamed of it,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Razumihin made haste to apologise. \xe2\x80\x9cBut... but you can\xe2\x80\x99t be angry with\r\nme for speaking so! For I speak sincerely and not because... hm, hm!\r\nThat would be disgraceful; in fact not because I\xe2\x80\x99m in... hm! Well,\r\nanyway, I won\xe2\x80\x99t say why, I daren\xe2\x80\x99t.... But we all saw to-day when he\r\ncame in that that man is not of our sort. Not because he had his hair\r\ncurled at the barber\xe2\x80\x99s, not because he was in such a hurry to show his\r\nwit, but because he is a spy, a speculator, because he is a skin-flint\r\nand a buffoon. That\xe2\x80\x99s evident. Do you think him clever? No, he is a\r\nfool, a fool. And is he a match for you? Good heavens! Do you see,\r\nladies?\xe2\x80\x9d he stopped suddenly on the way upstairs to their rooms, \xe2\x80\x9cthough\r\nall my friends there are drunk, yet they are all honest, and though we\r\ndo talk a lot of trash, and I do, too, yet we shall talk our way to the\r\ntruth at last, for we are on the right path, while Pyotr Petrovitch...\r\nis not on the right path. Though I\xe2\x80\x99ve been calling them all sorts of\r\nnames just now, I do respect them all... though I don\xe2\x80\x99t respect Zametov,\r\nI like him, for he is a puppy, and that bullock Zossimov, because he\r\nis an honest man and knows his work. But enough, it\xe2\x80\x99s all said and\r\nforgiven. Is it forgiven? Well, then, let\xe2\x80\x99s go on. I know this corridor,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve been here, there was a scandal here at Number 3.... Where are you\r\nhere? Which number? eight? Well, lock yourselves in for the night, then.\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t let anybody in. In a quarter of an hour I\xe2\x80\x99ll come back with news,\r\nand half an hour later I\xe2\x80\x99ll bring Zossimov, you\xe2\x80\x99ll see! Good-bye, I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nrun.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood heavens, Dounia, what is going to happen?\xe2\x80\x9d said Pulcheria\r\nAlexandrovna, addressing her daughter with anxiety and dismay.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t worry yourself, mother,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dounia, taking off her hat and\r\ncape. \xe2\x80\x9cGod has sent this gentleman to our aid, though he has come from a\r\ndrinking party. We can depend on him, I assure you. And all that he has\r\ndone for Rodya....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh. Dounia, goodness knows whether he will come! How could I bring\r\nmyself to leave Rodya?... And how different, how different I had fancied\r\nour meeting! How sullen he was, as though not pleased to see us....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTears came into her eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it\xe2\x80\x99s not that, mother. You didn\xe2\x80\x99t see, you were crying all the\r\ntime. He is quite unhinged by serious illness--that\xe2\x80\x99s the reason.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, that illness! What will happen, what will happen? And how he talked\r\nto you, Dounia!\xe2\x80\x9d said the mother, looking timidly at her daughter,\r\ntrying to read her thoughts and, already half consoled by Dounia\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstanding up for her brother, which meant that she had already forgiven\r\nhim. \xe2\x80\x9cI am sure he will think better of it to-morrow,\xe2\x80\x9d she added,\r\nprobing her further.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I am sure that he will say the same to-morrow... about that,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Avdotya Romanovna said finally. And, of course, there was no going\r\nbeyond that, for this was a point which Pulcheria Alexandrovna was\r\nafraid to discuss. Dounia went up and kissed her mother. The latter\r\nwarmly embraced her without speaking. Then she sat down to wait\r\nanxiously for Razumihin\xe2\x80\x99s return, timidly watching her daughter who\r\nwalked up and down the room with her arms folded, lost in thought.\r\nThis walking up and down when she was thinking was a habit of Avdotya\r\nRomanovna\xe2\x80\x99s and the mother was always afraid to break in on her\r\ndaughter\xe2\x80\x99s mood at such moments.\r\n\r\nRazumihin, of course, was ridiculous in his sudden drunken infatuation\r\nfor Avdotya Romanovna. Yet apart from his eccentric condition, many\r\npeople would have thought it justified if they had seen Avdotya\r\nRomanovna, especially at that moment when she was walking to and\r\nfro with folded arms, pensive and melancholy. Avdotya Romanovna was\r\nremarkably good-looking; she was tall, strikingly well-proportioned,\r\nstrong and self-reliant--the latter quality was apparent in every\r\ngesture, though it did not in the least detract from the grace and\r\nsoftness of her movements. In face she resembled her brother, but she\r\nmight be described as really beautiful. Her hair was dark brown, a\r\nlittle lighter than her brother\xe2\x80\x99s; there was a proud light in her almost\r\nblack eyes and yet at times a look of extraordinary kindness. She was\r\npale, but it was a healthy pallor; her face was radiant with freshness\r\nand vigour. Her mouth was rather small; the full red lower lip projected\r\na little as did her chin; it was the only irregularity in her beautiful\r\nface, but it gave it a peculiarly individual and almost haughty\r\nexpression. Her face was always more serious and thoughtful than gay;\r\nbut how well smiles, how well youthful, lighthearted, irresponsible,\r\nlaughter suited her face! It was natural enough that a warm, open,\r\nsimple-hearted, honest giant like Razumihin, who had never seen anyone\r\nlike her and was not quite sober at the time, should lose his head\r\nimmediately. Besides, as chance would have it, he saw Dounia for the\r\nfirst time transfigured by her love for her brother and her joy at\r\nmeeting him. Afterwards he saw her lower lip quiver with indignation\r\nat her brother\xe2\x80\x99s insolent, cruel and ungrateful words--and his fate was\r\nsealed.\r\n\r\nHe had spoken the truth, moreover, when he blurted out in his drunken\r\ntalk on the stairs that Praskovya Pavlovna, Raskolnikov\xe2\x80\x99s eccentric\r\nlandlady, would be jealous of Pulcheria Alexandrovna as well as of\r\nAvdotya Romanovna on his account. Although Pulcheria Alexandrovna was\r\nforty-three, her face still retained traces of her former beauty; she\r\nlooked much younger than her age, indeed, which is almost always the\r\ncase with women who retain serenity of spirit, sensitiveness and pure\r\nsincere warmth of heart to old age. We may add in parenthesis that to\r\npreserve all this is the only means of retaining beauty to old age. Her\r\nhair had begun to grow grey and thin, there had long been little crow\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfoot wrinkles round her eyes, her cheeks were hollow and sunken from\r\nanxiety and grief, and yet it was a handsome face. She was Dounia\r\nover again, twenty years older, but without the projecting underlip.\r\nPulcheria Alexandrovna was emotional, but not sentimental, timid and\r\nyielding, but only to a certain point. She could give way and accept a\r\ngreat deal even of what was contrary to her convictions, but there was a\r\ncertain barrier fixed by honesty, principle and the deepest convictions\r\nwhich nothing would induce her to cross.\r\n\r\nExactly twenty minutes after Razumihin\xe2\x80\x99s departure, there came two\r\nsubdued but hurried knocks at the door: he had come back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t come in, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t time,\xe2\x80\x9d he hastened to say when the door was\r\nopened. \xe2\x80\x9cHe sleeps like a top, soundly, quietly, and God grant he may\r\nsleep ten hours. Nastasya\xe2\x80\x99s with him; I told her not to leave till I\r\ncame. Now I am fetching Zossimov, he will report to you and then you\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nbetter turn in; I can see you are too tired to do anything....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he ran off down the corridor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a very competent and... devoted young man!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Pulcheria\r\nAlexandrovna exceedingly delighted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe seems a splendid person!\xe2\x80\x9d Avdotya Romanovna replied with some\r\nwarmth, resuming her walk up and down the room.\r\n\r\nIt was nearly an hour later when they heard footsteps in the corridor\r\nand another knock at the door. Both women waited this time completely\r\nrelying on Razumihin\xe2\x80\x99s promise; he actually had succeeded in bringing\r\nZossimov. Zossimov had agreed at once to desert the drinking party to\r\ngo to Raskolnikov\xe2\x80\x99s, but he came reluctantly and with the greatest\r\nsuspicion to see the ladies, mistrusting Razumihin in his exhilarated\r\ncondition. But his vanity was at once reassured and flattered; he saw\r\nthat they were really expecting him as an oracle. He stayed just ten\r\nminutes and succeeded in completely convincing and comforting Pulcheria\r\nAlexandrovna. He spoke with marked sympathy, but with the reserve and\r\nextreme seriousness of a young doctor at an important consultation.\r\nHe did not utter a word on any other subject and did not display the\r\nslightest desire to enter into more personal relations with the two\r\nladies. Remarking at his first entrance the dazzling beauty of Avdotya\r\nRomanovna, he endeavoured not to notice her at all during his visit and\r\naddressed himself solely to Pulcheria Alexandrovna. All this gave him\r\nextraordinary inward satisfaction. He declared that he thought the\r\ninvalid at this moment going on very satisfactorily. According to his\r\nobservations the patient\xe2\x80\x99s illness was due partly to his unfortunate\r\nmaterial surroundings during the last few months, but it had partly also\r\na moral origin, \xe2\x80\x9cwas, so to speak, the product of several material and\r\nmoral influences, anxieties, apprehensions, troubles, certain ideas...\r\nand so on.\xe2\x80\x9d Noticing stealthily that Avdotya Romanovna was following his\r\nwords with close attention, Zossimov allowed himself to enlarge on this\r\ntheme. On Pulcheria Alexandrovna\xe2\x80\x99s anxiously and timidly inquiring as\r\nto \xe2\x80\x9csome suspicion of insanity,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied with a composed and candid\r\nsmile that his words had been exaggerated; that certainly the patient\r\nhad some fixed idea, something approaching a monomania--he, Zossimov,\r\nwas now particularly studying this interesting branch of medicine--but\r\nthat it must be recollected that until to-day the patient had been in\r\ndelirium and... and that no doubt the presence of his family would have\r\na favourable effect on his recovery and distract his mind, \xe2\x80\x9cif only all\r\nfresh shocks can be avoided,\xe2\x80\x9d he added significantly. Then he got up,\r\ntook leave with an impressive and affable bow, while blessings, warm\r\ngratitude, and entreaties were showered upon him, and Avdotya Romanovna\r\nspontaneously offered her hand to him. He went out exceedingly pleased\r\nwith his visit and still more so with himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll talk to-morrow; go to bed at once!\xe2\x80\x9d Razumihin said in conclusion,\r\nfollowing Zossimov out. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll be with you to-morrow morning as early as\r\npossible with my report.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a fetching little girl, Avdotya Romanovna,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Zossimov,\r\nalmost licking his lips as they both came out into the street.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFetching? You said fetching?\xe2\x80\x9d roared Razumihin and he flew at Zossimov\r\nand seized him by the throat. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you ever dare.... Do you understand?\r\nDo you understand?\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted, shaking him by the collar and squeezing\r\nhim against the wall. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you hear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me go, you drunken devil,\xe2\x80\x9d said Zossimov, struggling and when he\r\nhad let him go, he stared at him and went off into a sudden guffaw.\r\nRazumihin stood facing him in gloomy and earnest reflection.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, I am an ass,\xe2\x80\x9d he observed, sombre as a storm cloud, \xe2\x80\x9cbut\r\nstill... you are another.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, brother, not at all such another. I am not dreaming of any folly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey walked along in silence and only when they were close to\r\nRaskolnikov\xe2\x80\x99s lodgings, Razumihin broke the silence in considerable\r\nanxiety.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re a first-rate fellow, but among your other\r\nfailings, you\xe2\x80\x99re a loose fish, that I know, and a dirty one, too. You\r\nare a feeble, nervous wretch, and a mass of whims, you\xe2\x80\x99re getting fat\r\nand lazy and can\xe2\x80\x99t deny yourself anything--and I call that dirty because\r\nit leads one straight into the dirt. You\xe2\x80\x99ve let yourself get so slack\r\nthat I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how it is you are still a good, even a devoted doctor.\r\nYou--a doctor--sleep on a feather bed and get up at night to your\r\npatients! In another three or four years you won\xe2\x80\x99t get up for your\r\npatients... But hang it all, that\xe2\x80\x99s not the point!... You are going\r\nto spend to-night in the landlady\xe2\x80\x99s flat here. (Hard work I\xe2\x80\x99ve had to\r\npersuade her!) And I\xe2\x80\x99ll be in the kitchen. So here\xe2\x80\x99s a chance for you to\r\nget to know her better.... It\xe2\x80\x99s not as you think! There\xe2\x80\x99s not a trace of\r\nanything of the sort, brother...!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I don\xe2\x80\x99t think!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere you have modesty, brother, silence, bashfulness, a savage\r\nvirtue... and yet she\xe2\x80\x99s sighing and melting like wax, simply melting!\r\nSave me from her, by all that\xe2\x80\x99s unholy! She\xe2\x80\x99s most prepossessing... I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nrepay you, I\xe2\x80\x99ll do anything....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nZossimov laughed more violently than ever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you are smitten! But what am I to do with her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt won\xe2\x80\x99t be much trouble, I assure you. Talk any rot you like to her,\r\nas long as you sit by her and talk. You\xe2\x80\x99re a doctor, too; try curing\r\nher of something. I swear you won\xe2\x80\x99t regret it. She has a piano, and you\r\nknow, I strum a little. I have a song there, a genuine Russian one: \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nshed hot tears.\xe2\x80\x99 She likes the genuine article--and well, it all\r\nbegan with that song; Now you\xe2\x80\x99re a regular performer, a _ma\xc3\xaetre_, a\r\nRubinstein.... I assure you, you won\xe2\x80\x99t regret it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut have you made her some promise? Something signed? A promise of\r\nmarriage, perhaps?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing, nothing, absolutely nothing of the kind! Besides she is not\r\nthat sort at all.... Tchebarov tried that....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then, drop her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I can\xe2\x80\x99t drop her like that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy can\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I can\xe2\x80\x99t, that\xe2\x80\x99s all about it! There\xe2\x80\x99s an element of attraction\r\nhere, brother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen why have you fascinated her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t fascinated her; perhaps I was fascinated myself in my folly.\r\nBut she won\xe2\x80\x99t care a straw whether it\xe2\x80\x99s you or I, so long as somebody\r\nsits beside her, sighing.... I can\xe2\x80\x99t explain the position, brother...\r\nlook here, you are good at mathematics, and working at it now... begin\r\nteaching her the integral calculus; upon my soul, I\xe2\x80\x99m not joking, I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nin earnest, it\xe2\x80\x99ll be just the same to her. She will gaze at you and sigh\r\nfor a whole year together. I talked to her once for two days at a time\r\nabout the Prussian House of Lords (for one must talk of something)--she\r\njust sighed and perspired! And you mustn\xe2\x80\x99t talk of love--she\xe2\x80\x99s bashful\r\nto hysterics--but just let her see you can\xe2\x80\x99t tear yourself away--that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nenough. It\xe2\x80\x99s fearfully comfortable; you\xe2\x80\x99re quite at home, you can\r\nread, sit, lie about, write. You may even venture on a kiss, if you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\ncareful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what do I want with her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAch, I can\xe2\x80\x99t make you understand! You see, you are made for each other!\r\nI have often been reminded of you!... You\xe2\x80\x99ll come to it in the end! So\r\ndoes it matter whether it\xe2\x80\x99s sooner or later? There\xe2\x80\x99s the feather-bed\r\nelement here, brother--ach! and not only that! There\xe2\x80\x99s an attraction\r\nhere--here you have the end of the world, an anchorage, a quiet haven,\r\nthe navel of the earth, the three fishes that are the foundation of the\r\nworld, the essence of pancakes, of savoury fish-pies, of the evening\r\nsamovar, of soft sighs and warm shawls, and hot stoves to sleep on--as\r\nsnug as though you were dead, and yet you\xe2\x80\x99re alive--the advantages\r\nof both at once! Well, hang it, brother, what stuff I\xe2\x80\x99m talking, it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbedtime! Listen. I sometimes wake up at night; so I\xe2\x80\x99ll go in and look at\r\nhim. But there\xe2\x80\x99s no need, it\xe2\x80\x99s all right. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you worry yourself,\r\nyet if you like, you might just look in once, too. But if you notice\r\nanything--delirium or fever--wake me at once. But there can\xe2\x80\x99t be....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nRazumihin waked up next morning at eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock, troubled and serious.\r\nHe found himself confronted with many new and unlooked-for perplexities.\r\nHe had never expected that he would ever wake up feeling like that. He\r\nremembered every detail of the previous day and he knew that a perfectly\r\nnovel experience had befallen him, that he had received an impression\r\nunlike anything he had known before. At the same time he recognised\r\nclearly that the dream which had fired his imagination was hopelessly\r\nunattainable--so unattainable that he felt positively ashamed of it, and\r\nhe hastened to pass to the other more practical cares and difficulties\r\nbequeathed him by that \xe2\x80\x9cthrice accursed yesterday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe most awful recollection of the previous day was the way he had shown\r\nhimself \xe2\x80\x9cbase and mean,\xe2\x80\x9d not only because he had been drunk, but\r\nbecause he had taken advantage of the young girl\xe2\x80\x99s position to abuse\r\nher _fianc\xc3\xa9_ in his stupid jealousy, knowing nothing of their mutual\r\nrelations and obligations and next to nothing of the man himself. And\r\nwhat right had he to criticise him in that hasty and unguarded manner?\r\nWho had asked for his opinion? Was it thinkable that such a creature as\r\nAvdotya Romanovna would be marrying an unworthy man for money? So there\r\nmust be something in him. The lodgings? But after all how could he know\r\nthe character of the lodgings? He was furnishing a flat... Foo! how\r\ndespicable it all was! And what justification was it that he was drunk?\r\nSuch a stupid excuse was even more degrading! In wine is truth, and the\r\ntruth had all come out, \xe2\x80\x9cthat is, all the uncleanness of his coarse\r\nand envious heart\xe2\x80\x9d! And would such a dream ever be permissible to\r\nhim, Razumihin? What was he beside such a girl--he, the drunken noisy\r\nbraggart of last night? Was it possible to imagine so absurd and cynical\r\na juxtaposition? Razumihin blushed desperately at the very idea and\r\nsuddenly the recollection forced itself vividly upon him of how he had\r\nsaid last night on the stairs that the landlady would be jealous of\r\nAvdotya Romanovna... that was simply intolerable. He brought his fist\r\ndown heavily on the kitchen stove, hurt his hand and sent one of the\r\nbricks flying.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered to himself a minute later with a feeling of\r\nself-abasement, \xe2\x80\x9cof course, all these infamies can never be wiped out or\r\nsmoothed over... and so it\xe2\x80\x99s useless even to think of it, and I must\r\ngo to them in silence and do my duty... in silence, too... and not ask\r\nforgiveness, and say nothing... for all is lost now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd yet as he dressed he examined his attire more carefully than usual.\r\nHe hadn\xe2\x80\x99t another suit--if he had had, perhaps he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have put it\r\non. \xe2\x80\x9cI would have made a point of not putting it on.\xe2\x80\x9d But in any case he\r\ncould not remain a cynic and a dirty sloven; he had no right to offend\r\nthe feelings of others, especially when they were in need of his\r\nassistance and asking him to see them. He brushed his clothes carefully.\r\nHis linen was always decent; in that respect he was especially clean.\r\n\r\nHe washed that morning scrupulously--he got some soap from Nastasya--he\r\nwashed his hair, his neck and especially his hands. When it came to the\r\nquestion whether to shave his stubbly chin or not (Praskovya Pavlovna\r\nhad capital razors that had been left by her late husband), the question\r\nwas angrily answered in the negative. \xe2\x80\x9cLet it stay as it is! What if\r\nthey think that I shaved on purpose to...? They certainly would think\r\nso! Not on any account!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd... the worst of it was he was so coarse, so dirty, he had the\r\nmanners of a pothouse; and... and even admitting that he knew he had\r\nsome of the essentials of a gentleman... what was there in that to be\r\nproud of? Everyone ought to be a gentleman and more than that... and all\r\nthe same (he remembered) he, too, had done little things... not exactly\r\ndishonest, and yet.... And what thoughts he sometimes had; hm... and to\r\nset all that beside Avdotya Romanovna! Confound it! So be it! Well, he\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nmake a point then of being dirty, greasy, pothouse in his manners and he\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t care! He\xe2\x80\x99d be worse!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was engaged in such monologues when Zossimov, who had spent the night\r\nin Praskovya Pavlovna\xe2\x80\x99s parlour, came in.\r\n\r\nHe was going home and was in a hurry to look at the invalid first.\r\nRazumihin informed him that Raskolnikov was sleeping like a dormouse.\r\nZossimov gave orders that they shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t wake him and promised to see\r\nhim again about eleven.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf he is still at home,\xe2\x80\x9d he added. \xe2\x80\x9cDamn it all! If one can\xe2\x80\x99t control\r\none\xe2\x80\x99s patients, how is one to cure them? Do you know whether _he_ will\r\ngo to them, or whether _they_ are coming here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are coming, I think,\xe2\x80\x9d said Razumihin, understanding the object\r\nof the question, \xe2\x80\x9cand they will discuss their family affairs, no doubt.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll be off. You, as the doctor, have more right to be here than I.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I am not a father confessor; I shall come and go away; I\xe2\x80\x99ve plenty\r\nto do besides looking after them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne thing worries me,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed Razumihin, frowning. \xe2\x80\x9cOn the way home\r\nI talked a lot of drunken nonsense to him... all sorts of things... and\r\namongst them that you were afraid that he... might become insane.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou told the ladies so, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know it was stupid! You may beat me if you like! Did you think so\r\nseriously?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s nonsense, I tell you, how could I think it seriously? You,\r\nyourself, described him as a monomaniac when you fetched me to\r\nhim... and we added fuel to the fire yesterday, you did, that is, with\r\nyour story about the painter; it was a nice conversation, when he was,\r\nperhaps, mad on that very point! If only I\xe2\x80\x99d known what happened then\r\nat the police station and that some wretch... had insulted him with this\r\nsuspicion! Hm... I would not have allowed that conversation yesterday.\r\nThese monomaniacs will make a mountain out of a mole-hill... and\r\nsee their fancies as solid realities.... As far as I remember, it was\r\nZametov\xe2\x80\x99s story that cleared up half the mystery, to my mind. Why, I\r\nknow one case in which a hypochondriac, a man of forty, cut the throat\r\nof a little boy of eight, because he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t endure the jokes he made\r\nevery day at table! And in this case his rags, the insolent police\r\nofficer, the fever and this suspicion! All that working upon a man half\r\nfrantic with hypochondria, and with his morbid exceptional vanity! That\r\nmay well have been the starting-point of illness. Well, bother it\r\nall!... And, by the way, that Zametov certainly is a nice fellow, but\r\nhm... he shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have told all that last night. He is an awful\r\nchatterbox!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut whom did he tell it to? You and me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Porfiry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does that matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd, by the way, have you any influence on them, his mother and sister?\r\nTell them to be more careful with him to-day....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ll get on all right!\xe2\x80\x9d Razumihin answered reluctantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy is he so set against this Luzhin? A man with money and she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nseem to dislike him... and they haven\xe2\x80\x99t a farthing, I suppose? eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what business is it of yours?\xe2\x80\x9d Razumihin cried with annoyance. \xe2\x80\x9cHow\r\ncan I tell whether they\xe2\x80\x99ve a farthing? Ask them yourself and perhaps\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll find out....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFoo! what an ass you are sometimes! Last night\xe2\x80\x99s wine has not gone off\r\nyet.... Good-bye; thank your Praskovya Pavlovna from me for my night\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlodging. She locked herself in, made no reply to my _bonjour_ through\r\nthe door; she was up at seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock, the samovar was taken into her\r\nfrom the kitchen. I was not vouchsafed a personal interview....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock precisely Razumihin reached the lodgings at Bakaleyev\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhouse. Both ladies were waiting for him with nervous impatience. They\r\nhad risen at seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock or earlier. He entered looking as black as\r\nnight, bowed awkwardly and was at once furious with himself for it. He\r\nhad reckoned without his host: Pulcheria Alexandrovna fairly rushed at\r\nhim, seized him by both hands and was almost kissing them. He glanced\r\ntimidly at Avdotya Romanovna, but her proud countenance wore at that\r\nmoment an expression of such gratitude and friendliness, such\r\ncomplete and unlooked-for respect (in place of the sneering looks and\r\nill-disguised contempt he had expected), that it threw him into greater\r\nconfusion than if he had been met with abuse. Fortunately there was a\r\nsubject for conversation, and he made haste to snatch at it.\r\n\r\nHearing that everything was going well and that Rodya had not yet waked,\r\nPulcheria Alexandrovna declared that she was glad to hear it, because\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cshe had something which it was very, very necessary to talk over\r\nbeforehand.\xe2\x80\x9d Then followed an inquiry about breakfast and an invitation\r\nto have it with them; they had waited to have it with him. Avdotya\r\nRomanovna rang the bell: it was answered by a ragged dirty waiter, and\r\nthey asked him to bring tea which was served at last, but in such\r\na dirty and disorderly way that the ladies were ashamed. Razumihin\r\nvigorously attacked the lodgings, but, remembering Luzhin, stopped\r\nin embarrassment and was greatly relieved by Pulcheria Alexandrovna\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nquestions, which showered in a continual stream upon him.\r\n\r\nHe talked for three quarters of an hour, being constantly interrupted\r\nby their questions, and succeeded in describing to them all the\r\nmost important facts he knew of the last year of Raskolnikov\xe2\x80\x99s life,\r\nconcluding with a circumstantial account of his illness. He omitted,\r\nhowever, many things, which were better omitted, including the scene at\r\nthe police station with all its consequences. They listened eagerly\r\nto his story, and, when he thought he had finished and satisfied his\r\nlisteners, he found that they considered he had hardly begun.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me, tell me! What do you think...? Excuse me, I still don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nyour name!\xe2\x80\x9d Pulcheria Alexandrovna put in hastily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDmitri Prokofitch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should like very, very much to know, Dmitri Prokofitch... how he\r\nlooks... on things in general now, that is, how can I explain, what are\r\nhis likes and dislikes? Is he always so irritable? Tell me, if you can,\r\nwhat are his hopes and, so to say, his dreams? Under what influences is\r\nhe now? In a word, I should like...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, mother, how can he answer all that at once?\xe2\x80\x9d observed Dounia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood heavens, I had not expected to find him in the least like this,\r\nDmitri Prokofitch!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNaturally,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Razumihin. \xe2\x80\x9cI have no mother, but my uncle comes\r\nevery year and almost every time he can scarcely recognise me, even in\r\nappearance, though he is a clever man; and your three years\xe2\x80\x99 separation\r\nmeans a great deal. What am I to tell you? I have known Rodion for\r\na year and a half; he is morose, gloomy, proud and haughty, and of\r\nlate--and perhaps for a long time before--he has been suspicious and\r\nfanciful. He has a noble nature and a kind heart. He does not like\r\nshowing his feelings and would rather do a cruel thing than open his\r\nheart freely. Sometimes, though, he is not at all morbid, but simply\r\ncold and inhumanly callous; it\xe2\x80\x99s as though he were alternating between\r\ntwo characters. Sometimes he is fearfully reserved! He says he is\r\nso busy that everything is a hindrance, and yet he lies in bed doing\r\nnothing. He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t jeer at things, not because he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t the wit, but\r\nas though he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t time to waste on such trifles. He never listens\r\nto what is said to him. He is never interested in what interests other\r\npeople at any given moment. He thinks very highly of himself and perhaps\r\nhe is right. Well, what more? I think your arrival will have a most\r\nbeneficial influence upon him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod grant it may,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna, distressed by\r\nRazumihin\xe2\x80\x99s account of her Rodya.\r\n\r\nAnd Razumihin ventured to look more boldly at Avdotya Romanovna at last.\r\nHe glanced at her often while he was talking, but only for a moment and\r\nlooked away again at once. Avdotya Romanovna sat at the table, listening\r\nattentively, then got up again and began walking to and fro with her\r\narms folded and her lips compressed, occasionally putting in a question,\r\nwithout stopping her walk. She had the same habit of not listening to\r\nwhat was said. She was wearing a dress of thin dark stuff and she had a\r\nwhite transparent scarf round her neck. Razumihin soon detected signs of\r\nextreme poverty in their belongings. Had Avdotya Romanovna been dressed\r\nlike a queen, he felt that he would not be afraid of her, but perhaps\r\njust because she was poorly dressed and that he noticed all the misery\r\nof her surroundings, his heart was filled with dread and he began to be\r\nafraid of every word he uttered, every gesture he made, which was very\r\ntrying for a man who already felt diffident.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve told us a great deal that is interesting about my brother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncharacter... and have told it impartially. I am glad. I thought that you\r\nwere too uncritically devoted to him,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Avdotya Romanovna with\r\na smile. \xe2\x80\x9cI think you are right that he needs a woman\xe2\x80\x99s care,\xe2\x80\x9d she added\r\nthoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t say so; but I daresay you are right, only...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe loves no one and perhaps he never will,\xe2\x80\x9d Razumihin declared\r\ndecisively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean he is not capable of love?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know, Avdotya Romanovna, you are awfully like your brother, in\r\neverything, indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d he blurted out suddenly to his own surprise, but\r\nremembering at once what he had just before said of her brother,\r\nhe turned as red as a crab and was overcome with confusion. Avdotya\r\nRomanovna couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help laughing when she looked at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may both be mistaken about Rodya,\xe2\x80\x9d Pulcheria Alexandrovna remarked,\r\nslightly piqued. \xe2\x80\x9cI am not talking of our present difficulty, Dounia.\r\nWhat Pyotr Petrovitch writes in this letter and what you and I have\r\nsupposed may be mistaken, but you can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine, Dmitri Prokofitch, how\r\nmoody and, so to say, capricious he is. I never could depend on what\r\nhe would do when he was only fifteen. And I am sure that he might\r\ndo something now that nobody else would think of doing... Well, for\r\ninstance, do you know how a year and a half ago he astounded me and gave\r\nme a shock that nearly killed me, when he had the idea of marrying that\r\ngirl--what was her name--his landlady\xe2\x80\x99s daughter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you hear about that affair?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Avdotya Romanovna.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you suppose----\xe2\x80\x9d Pulcheria Alexandrovna continued warmly. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you\r\nsuppose that my tears, my entreaties, my illness, my possible death from\r\ngrief, our poverty would have made him pause? No, he would calmly have\r\ndisregarded all obstacles. And yet it isn\xe2\x80\x99t that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t love us!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has never spoken a word of that affair to me,\xe2\x80\x9d Razumihin answered\r\ncautiously. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I did hear something from Praskovya Pavlovna herself,\r\nthough she is by no means a gossip. And what I heard certainly was\r\nrather strange.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what did you hear?\xe2\x80\x9d both the ladies asked at once.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, nothing very special. I only learned that the marriage, which\r\nonly failed to take place through the girl\xe2\x80\x99s death, was not at all to\r\nPraskovya Pavlovna\xe2\x80\x99s liking. They say, too, the girl was not at all\r\npretty, in fact I am told positively ugly... and such an invalid... and\r\nqueer. But she seems to have had some good qualities. She must have\r\nhad some good qualities or it\xe2\x80\x99s quite inexplicable.... She had no money\r\neither and he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have considered her money.... But it\xe2\x80\x99s always\r\ndifficult to judge in such matters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sure she was a good girl,\xe2\x80\x9d Avdotya Romanovna observed briefly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod forgive me, I simply rejoiced at her death. Though I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nwhich of them would have caused most misery to the other--he to her\r\nor she to him,\xe2\x80\x9d Pulcheria Alexandrovna concluded. Then she began\r\ntentatively questioning him about the scene on the previous day with\r\nLuzhin, hesitating and continually glancing at Dounia, obviously to\r\nthe latter\xe2\x80\x99s annoyance. This incident more than all the rest evidently\r\ncaused her uneasiness, even consternation. Razumihin described it in\r\ndetail again, but this time he added his own conclusions: he openly\r\nblamed Raskolnikov for intentionally insulting Pyotr Petrovitch, not\r\nseeking to excuse him on the score of his illness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe had planned it before his illness,\xe2\x80\x9d he added.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think so, too,\xe2\x80\x9d Pulcheria Alexandrovna agreed with a dejected air.\r\nBut she was very much surprised at hearing Razumihin express himself\r\nso carefully and even with a certain respect about Pyotr Petrovitch.\r\nAvdotya Romanovna, too, was struck by it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo this is your opinion of Pyotr Petrovitch?\xe2\x80\x9d Pulcheria Alexandrovna\r\ncould not resist asking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can have no other opinion of your daughter\xe2\x80\x99s future husband,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Razumihin answered firmly and with warmth, \xe2\x80\x9cand I don\xe2\x80\x99t say it simply\r\nfrom vulgar politeness, but because... simply because Avdotya Romanovna\r\nhas of her own free will deigned to accept this man. If I spoke so\r\nrudely of him last night, it was because I was disgustingly drunk and...\r\nmad besides; yes, mad, crazy, I lost my head completely... and this\r\nmorning I am ashamed of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe crimsoned and ceased speaking. Avdotya Romanovna flushed, but did not\r\nbreak the silence. She had not uttered a word from the moment they began\r\nto speak of Luzhin.\r\n\r\nWithout her support Pulcheria Alexandrovna obviously did not know what\r\nto do. At last, faltering and continually glancing at her daughter, she\r\nconfessed that she was exceedingly worried by one circumstance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, Dmitri Prokofitch,\xe2\x80\x9d she began. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll be perfectly open with\r\nDmitri Prokofitch, Dounia?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, mother,\xe2\x80\x9d said Avdotya Romanovna emphatically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is what it is,\xe2\x80\x9d she began in haste, as though the permission to\r\nspeak of her trouble lifted a weight off her mind. \xe2\x80\x9cVery early this\r\nmorning we got a note from Pyotr Petrovitch in reply to our letter\r\nannouncing our arrival. He promised to meet us at the station, you\r\nknow; instead of that he sent a servant to bring us the address of these\r\nlodgings and to show us the way; and he sent a message that he would\r\nbe here himself this morning. But this morning this note came from him.\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99d better read it yourself; there is one point in it which worries me\r\nvery much... you will soon see what that is, and... tell me your candid\r\nopinion, Dmitri Prokofitch! You know Rodya\xe2\x80\x99s character better than\r\nanyone and no one can advise us better than you can. Dounia, I must tell\r\nyou, made her decision at once, but I still don\xe2\x80\x99t feel sure how to act\r\nand I... I\xe2\x80\x99ve been waiting for your opinion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRazumihin opened the note which was dated the previous evening and read\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear Madam, Pulcheria Alexandrovna, I have the honour to inform you\r\nthat owing to unforeseen obstacles I was rendered unable to meet you at\r\nthe railway station; I sent a very competent person with the same object\r\nin view. I likewise shall be deprived of the honour of an interview with\r\nyou to-morrow morning by business in the Senate that does not admit of\r\ndelay, and also that I may not intrude on your family circle while you\r\nare meeting your son, and Avdotya Romanovna her brother. I shall have\r\nthe honour of visiting you and paying you my respects at your lodgings\r\nnot later than to-morrow evening at eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock precisely, and\r\nherewith I venture to present my earnest and, I may add, imperative\r\nrequest that Rodion Romanovitch may not be present at our interview--as\r\nhe offered me a gross and unprecedented affront on the occasion of my\r\nvisit to him in his illness yesterday, and, moreover, since I desire\r\nfrom you personally an indispensable and circumstantial explanation\r\nupon a certain point, in regard to which I wish to learn your own\r\ninterpretation. I have the honour to inform you, in anticipation,\r\nthat if, in spite of my request, I meet Rodion Romanovitch, I shall be\r\ncompelled to withdraw immediately and then you have only yourself to\r\nblame. I write on the assumption that Rodion Romanovitch who appeared so\r\nill at my visit, suddenly recovered two hours later and so, being able\r\nto leave the house, may visit you also. I was confirmed in that belief\r\nby the testimony of my own eyes in the lodging of a drunken man who\r\nwas run over and has since died, to whose daughter, a young woman of\r\nnotorious behaviour, he gave twenty-five roubles on the pretext of the\r\nfuneral, which gravely surprised me knowing what pains you were at to\r\nraise that sum. Herewith expressing my special respect to your estimable\r\ndaughter, Avdotya Romanovna, I beg you to accept the respectful homage\r\nof\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour humble servant,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cP. LUZHIN.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat am I to do now, Dmitri Prokofitch?\xe2\x80\x9d began Pulcheria Alexandrovna,\r\nalmost weeping. \xe2\x80\x9cHow can I ask Rodya not to come? Yesterday he insisted\r\nso earnestly on our refusing Pyotr Petrovitch and now we are ordered not\r\nto receive Rodya! He will come on purpose if he knows, and... what will\r\nhappen then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAct on Avdotya Romanovna\xe2\x80\x99s decision,\xe2\x80\x9d Razumihin answered calmly at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, dear me! She says... goodness knows what she says, she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nexplain her object! She says that it would be best, at least, not that\r\nit would be best, but that it\xe2\x80\x99s absolutely necessary that Rodya should\r\nmake a point of being here at eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock and that they must meet....\r\nI didn\xe2\x80\x99t want even to show him the letter, but to prevent him\r\nfrom coming by some stratagem with your help... because he is so\r\nirritable.... Besides I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand about that drunkard who died\r\nand that daughter, and how he could have given the daughter all the\r\nmoney... which...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich cost you such sacrifice, mother,\xe2\x80\x9d put in Avdotya Romanovna.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was not himself yesterday,\xe2\x80\x9d Razumihin said thoughtfully, \xe2\x80\x9cif you\r\nonly knew what he was up to in a restaurant yesterday, though there\r\nwas sense in it too.... Hm! He did say something, as we were going home\r\nyesterday evening, about a dead man and a girl, but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand\r\na word.... But last night, I myself...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe best thing, mother, will be for us to go to him ourselves and\r\nthere I assure you we shall see at once what\xe2\x80\x99s to be done. Besides,\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s getting late--good heavens, it\xe2\x80\x99s past ten,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried looking at\r\na splendid gold enamelled watch which hung round her neck on a thin\r\nVenetian chain, and looked entirely out of keeping with the rest of her\r\ndress. \xe2\x80\x9cA present from her _fianc\xc3\xa9_,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Razumihin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must start, Dounia, we must start,\xe2\x80\x9d her mother cried in a flutter.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe will be thinking we are still angry after yesterday, from our coming\r\nso late. Merciful heavens!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile she said this she was hurriedly putting on her hat and mantle;\r\nDounia, too, put on her things. Her gloves, as Razumihin noticed, were\r\nnot merely shabby but had holes in them, and yet this evident poverty\r\ngave the two ladies an air of special dignity, which is always found in\r\npeople who know how to wear poor clothes. Razumihin looked reverently\r\nat Dounia and felt proud of escorting her. \xe2\x80\x9cThe queen who mended her\r\nstockings in prison,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, \xe2\x80\x9cmust have looked then every inch a\r\nqueen and even more a queen than at sumptuous banquets and lev\xc3\xa9es.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy God!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Pulcheria Alexandrovna, \xe2\x80\x9clittle did I think that I\r\nshould ever fear seeing my son, my darling, darling Rodya! I am afraid,\r\nDmitri Prokofitch,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, glancing at him timidly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid, mother,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dounia, kissing her, \xe2\x80\x9cbetter have faith\r\nin him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, dear, I have faith in him, but I haven\xe2\x80\x99t slept all night,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n exclaimed the poor woman.\r\n\r\nThey came out into the street.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know, Dounia, when I dozed a little this morning I dreamed of\r\nMarfa Petrovna... she was all in white... she came up to me, took\r\nmy hand, and shook her head at me, but so sternly as though she were\r\nblaming me.... Is that a good omen? Oh, dear me! You don\xe2\x80\x99t know, Dmitri\r\nProkofitch, that Marfa Petrovna\xe2\x80\x99s dead!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know; who is Marfa Petrovna?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe died suddenly; and only fancy...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfterwards, mamma,\xe2\x80\x9d put in Dounia. \xe2\x80\x9cHe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know who Marfa Petrovna\r\nis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you don\xe2\x80\x99t know? And I was thinking that you knew all about us.\r\nForgive me, Dmitri Prokofitch, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what I am thinking about\r\nthese last few days. I look upon you really as a providence for us, and\r\nso I took it for granted that you knew all about us. I look on you as a\r\nrelation.... Don\xe2\x80\x99t be angry with me for saying so. Dear me, what\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nmatter with your right hand? Have you knocked it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I bruised it,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Razumihin overjoyed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI sometimes speak too much from the heart, so that Dounia finds fault\r\nwith me.... But, dear me, what a cupboard he lives in! I wonder whether\r\nhe is awake? Does this woman, his landlady, consider it a room? Listen,\r\nyou say he does not like to show his feelings, so perhaps I shall annoy\r\nhim with my... weaknesses? Do advise me, Dmitri Prokofitch, how am I to\r\ntreat him? I feel quite distracted, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t question him too much about anything if you see him frown; don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nask him too much about his health; he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, Dmitri Prokofitch, how hard it is to be a mother! But here are the\r\nstairs.... What an awful staircase!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMother, you are quite pale, don\xe2\x80\x99t distress yourself, darling,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nDounia caressing her, then with flashing eyes she added: \xe2\x80\x9cHe ought to be\r\nhappy at seeing you, and you are tormenting yourself so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait, I\xe2\x80\x99ll peep in and see whether he has waked up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe ladies slowly followed Razumihin, who went on before, and when they\r\nreached the landlady\xe2\x80\x99s door on the fourth storey, they noticed that her\r\ndoor was a tiny crack open and that two keen black eyes were watching\r\nthem from the darkness within. When their eyes met, the door was\r\nsuddenly shut with such a slam that Pulcheria Alexandrovna almost cried\r\nout.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is well, quite well!\xe2\x80\x9d Zossimov cried cheerfully as they entered.\r\n\r\nHe had come in ten minutes earlier and was sitting in the same place\r\nas before, on the sofa. Raskolnikov was sitting in the opposite corner,\r\nfully dressed and carefully washed and combed, as he had not been for\r\nsome time past. The room was immediately crowded, yet Nastasya managed\r\nto follow the visitors in and stayed to listen.\r\n\r\nRaskolnikov really was almost well, as compared with his condition the\r\nday before, but he was still pale, listless, and sombre. He looked like\r\na wounded man or one who has undergone some terrible physical suffering.\r\nHis brows were knitted, his lips compressed, his eyes feverish. He spoke\r\nlittle and reluctantly, as though performing a duty, and there was a\r\nrestlessness in his movements.\r\n\r\nHe only wanted a sling on his arm or a bandage on his finger to complete\r\nthe impression of a man with a painful abscess or a broken arm. The\r\npale, sombre face lighted up for a moment when his mother and sister\r\nentered, but this only gave it a look of more intense suffering, in\r\nplace of its listless dejection. The light soon died away, but the look\r\nof suffering remained, and Zossimov, watching and studying his patient\r\nwith all the zest of a young doctor beginning to practise, noticed\r\nin him no joy at the arrival of his mother and sister, but a sort of\r\nbitter, hidden determination to bear another hour or two of inevitable\r\ntorture. He saw later that almost every word of the following\r\nconversation seemed to touch on some sore place and irritate it. But\r\nat the same time he marvelled at the power of controlling himself\r\nand hiding his feelings in a patient who the previous day had, like a\r\nmonomaniac, fallen into a frenzy at the slightest word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I see myself now that I am almost well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Raskolnikov,\r\ngiving his mother and sister a kiss of welcome which made Pulcheria\r\nAlexandrovna radiant at once. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I don\xe2\x80\x99t say this _as I did\r\nyesterday_,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, addressing Razumihin, with a friendly pressure of\r\nhis hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, indeed, I am quite surprised at him to-day,\xe2\x80\x9d began Zossimov, much\r\ndelighted at the ladies\xe2\x80\x99 entrance, for he had not succeeded in keeping\r\nup a conversation with his patient for ten minutes. \xe2\x80\x9cIn another three or\r\nfour days, if he goes on like this, he will be just as before, that is,\r\nas he was a month ago, or two... or perhaps even three. This has been\r\ncoming on for a long while.... eh? Confess, now, that it has been\r\nperhaps your own fault?\xe2\x80\x9d he added, with a tentative smile, as though\r\nstill afraid of irritating him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is very possible,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Raskolnikov coldly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should say, too,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Zossimov with zest, \xe2\x80\x9cthat your complete\r\nrecovery depends solely on yourself. Now that one can talk to you,\r\nI should like to impress upon you that it is essential to avoid the\r\nelementary, so to speak, fundamental causes tending to produce your\r\nmorbid condition: in that case you will be cured, if not, it will go\r\nfrom bad to worse. These fundamental causes I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, but they must\r\nbe known to you. You are an intelligent man, and must have observed\r\nyourself, of course. I fancy the first stage of your derangement\r\ncoincides with your leaving the university. You must not be left without\r\noccupation, and so, work and a definite aim set before you might, I\r\nfancy, be very beneficial.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes; you are perfectly right.... I will make haste and return to\r\nthe university: and then everything will go smoothly....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nZossimov, who had begun his sage advice partly to make an effect before\r\nthe ladies, was certainly somewhat mystified, when, glancing at his\r\npatient, he observed unmistakable mockery on his face. This lasted\r\nan instant, however. Pulcheria Alexandrovna began at once thanking\r\nZossimov, especially for his visit to their lodging the previous night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! he saw you last night?\xe2\x80\x9d Raskolnikov asked, as though startled.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you have not slept either after your journey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAch, Rodya, that was only till two o\xe2\x80\x99clock. Dounia and I never go to\r\nbed before two at home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to thank him either,\xe2\x80\x9d Raskolnikov went on,\r\nsuddenly frowning and looking down. \xe2\x80\x9cSetting aside the question of\r\npayment--forgive me for referring to it (he turned to Zossimov)--I\r\nreally don\xe2\x80\x99t know what I have done to deserve such special attention\r\nfrom you! I simply don\xe2\x80\x99t understand it... and... and... it weighs upon\r\nme, indeed, because I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand it. I tell you so candidly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be irritated.\xe2\x80\x9d Zossimov forced himself to laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cAssume that you\r\nare my first patient--well--we fellows just beginning to practise love\r\nour first patients as if they were our children, and some almost fall in\r\nlove with them. And, of course, I am not rich in patients.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say nothing about him,\xe2\x80\x9d added Raskolnikov, pointing to Razumihin,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthough he has had nothing from me either but insult and trouble.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat nonsense he is talking! Why, you are in a sentimental mood to-day,\r\nare you?\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Razumihin.\r\n\r\nIf he had had more penetration he would have seen that there was no\r\ntrace of sentimentality in him, but something indeed quite the opposite.\r\nBut Avdotya Romanovna noticed it. She was intently and uneasily watching\r\nher brother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs for you, mother, I don\xe2\x80\x99t dare to speak,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, as though\r\nrepeating a lesson learned by heart. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is only to-day that I have\r\nbeen able to realise a little how distressed you must have been here\r\nyesterday, waiting for me to come back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen he had said this, he suddenly held out his hand to his sister,\r\nsmiling without a word. But in this smile there was a flash of real\r\nunfeigned feeling. Dounia caught it at once, and warmly pressed his\r\nhand, overjoyed and thankful. It was the first time he had addressed her\r\nsince their dispute the previous day. The mother\xe2\x80\x99s face lighted up\r\nwith ecstatic happiness at the sight of this conclusive unspoken\r\nreconciliation. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, that is what I love him for,\xe2\x80\x9d Razumihin,\r\nexaggerating it all, muttered to himself, with a vigorous turn in his\r\nchair. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has these movements.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how well he does it all,\xe2\x80\x9d the mother was thinking to herself. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\ngenerous impulses he has, and how simply, how delicately he put an end\r\nto all the misunderstanding with his sister--simply by holding out his\r\nhand at the right minute and looking at her like that.... And what\r\nfine eyes he has, and how fine his whole face is!... He is even better\r\nlooking than Dounia.... But, good heavens, what a suit--how terribly\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s dressed!... Vasya, the messenger boy in Afanasy Ivanitch\xe2\x80\x99s shop, is\r\nbetter dressed! I could rush at him and hug him... weep over him--but\r\nI am afraid.... Oh, dear, he\xe2\x80\x99s so strange! He\xe2\x80\x99s talking kindly, but I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nafraid! Why, what am I afraid of?...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Rodya, you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t believe,\xe2\x80\x9d she began suddenly, in haste to\r\nanswer his words to her, \xe2\x80\x9chow unhappy Dounia and I were yesterday! Now\r\nthat it\xe2\x80\x99s all over and done with and we are quite happy again--I can\r\ntell you. Fancy, we ran here almost straight from the train to embrace\r\nyou and that woman--ah, here she is! Good morning, Nastasya!... She told\r\nus at once that you were lying in a high fever and had just run away\r\nfrom the doctor in delirium, and they were looking for you in the\r\nstreets. You can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine how we felt! I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help thinking of the\r\ntragic end of Lieutenant Potanchikov, a friend of your father\xe2\x80\x99s--you\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t remember him, Rodya--who ran out in the same way in a high fever\r\nand fell into the well in the court-yard and they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t pull him out\r\ntill next day. Of course, we exaggerated things. We were on the point of\r\nrushing to find Pyotr Petrovitch to ask him to help.... Because we were\r\nalone, utterly alone,\xe2\x80\x9d she said plaintively and stopped short,\r\nsuddenly, recollecting it was still somewhat dangerous to speak of Pyotr\r\nPetrovitch, although \xe2\x80\x9cwe are quite happy again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes.... Of course it\xe2\x80\x99s very annoying....\xe2\x80\x9d Raskolnikov muttered in\r\nreply, but with such a preoccupied and inattentive air that Dounia gazed\r\nat him in perplexity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat else was it I wanted to say?\xe2\x80\x9d He went on trying to recollect. \xe2\x80\x9cOh,\r\nyes; mother, and you too, Dounia, please don\xe2\x80\x99t think that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean\r\nto come and see you to-day and was waiting for you to come first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you saying, Rodya?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna. She, too,\r\nwas surprised.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he answering us as a duty?\xe2\x80\x9d Dounia wondered. \xe2\x80\x9cIs he being reconciled\r\nand asking forgiveness as though he were performing a rite or repeating\r\na lesson?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve only just waked up, and wanted to go to you, but was delayed owing\r\nto my clothes; I forgot yesterday to ask her... Nastasya... to wash out\r\nthe blood... I\xe2\x80\x99ve only just dressed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBlood! What blood?\xe2\x80\x9d Pulcheria Alexandrovna asked in alarm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, nothing--don\xe2\x80\x99t be uneasy. It was when I was wandering about\r\nyesterday, rather delirious, I chanced upon a man who had been run\r\nover... a clerk...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDelirious? But you remember everything!\xe2\x80\x9d Razumihin interrupted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s true,\xe2\x80\x9d Raskolnikov answered with special carefulness. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nremember everything even to the slightest detail, and yet--why I did\r\nthat and went there and said that, I can\xe2\x80\x99t clearly explain now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA familiar phenomenon,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed Zossimov, \xe2\x80\x9cactions are sometimes\r\nperformed in a masterly and most cunning way, while the direction of the\r\nactions is deranged and dependent on various morbid impressions--it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlike a dream.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps it\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing really that he should think me almost a\r\nmadman,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Raskolnikov.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, people in perfect health act in the same way too,\xe2\x80\x9d observed\r\nDounia, looking uneasily at Zossimov.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is some truth in your observation,\xe2\x80\x9d the latter replied. \xe2\x80\x9cIn that\r\nsense we are certainly all not infrequently like madmen, but with the\r\nslight difference that the deranged are somewhat madder, for we\r\nmust draw a line. A normal man, it is true, hardly exists. Among\r\ndozens--perhaps hundreds of thousands--hardly one is to be met with.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the word \xe2\x80\x9cmadman,\xe2\x80\x9d carelessly dropped by Zossimov in his chatter on\r\nhis favourite subject, everyone frowned.\r\n\r\nRaskolnikov sat seeming not to pay attention, plunged in thought with a\r\nstrange smile on his pale lips. He was still meditating on something.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what about the man who was run over? I interrupted you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Razumihin cried hastily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d Raskolnikov seemed to wake up. \xe2\x80\x9cOh... I got spattered with\r\nblood helping to carry him to his lodging. By the way, mamma, I did an\r\nunpardonable thing yesterday. I was literally out of my mind. I gave\r\naway all the money you sent me... to his wife for the funeral. She\xe2\x80\x99s\r\na widow now, in consumption, a poor creature... three little children,\r\nstarving... nothing in the house... there\xe2\x80\x99s a daughter, too... perhaps\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99d have given it yourself if you\xe2\x80\x99d seen them. But I had no right to\r\ndo it I admit, especially as I knew how you needed the money yourself.\r\nTo help others one must have the right to do it, or else _Crevez,\r\nchiens, si vous n\xe2\x80\x99\xc3\xaates pas contents_.\xe2\x80\x9d He laughed, \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s right, isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nit, Dounia?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it\xe2\x80\x99s not,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Dounia firmly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBah! you, too, have ideals,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered, looking at her almost with\r\nhatred, and smiling sarcastically. \xe2\x80\x9cI ought to have considered that....\r\nWell, that\xe2\x80\x99s praiseworthy, and it\xe2\x80\x99s better for you... and if you reach a\r\nline you won\xe2\x80\x99t overstep, you will be unhappy... and if you overstep it,\r\nmaybe you will be still unhappier.... But all that\xe2\x80\x99s nonsense,\xe2\x80\x9d he added\r\nirritably, vexed at being carried away. \xe2\x80\x9cI only meant to say that I beg\r\nyour forgiveness, mother,\xe2\x80\x9d he concluded, shortly and abruptly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s enough, Rodya, I am sure that everything you do is very good,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said his mother, delighted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be too sure,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, twisting his mouth into a smile.\r\n\r\nA silence followed. There was a certain constraint in all this\r\nconversation, and in the silence, and in the reconciliation, and in the\r\nforgiveness, and all were feeling it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is as though they were afraid of me,\xe2\x80\x9d Raskolnikov was thinking\r\nto himself, looking askance at his mother and sister. Pulcheria\r\nAlexandrovna was indeed growing more timid the longer she kept silent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet in their absence I seemed to love them so much,\xe2\x80\x9d flashed through\r\nhis mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know, Rodya, Marfa Petrovna is dead,\xe2\x80\x9d Pulcheria Alexandrovna\r\nsuddenly blurted out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat Marfa Petrovna?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, mercy on us--Marfa Petrovna Svidriga\xc3\xaflov. I wrote you so much about\r\nher.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA-a-h! Yes, I remember.... So she\xe2\x80\x99s dead! Oh, really?\xe2\x80\x9d he roused\r\nhimself suddenly, as if waking up. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat did she die of?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly imagine, quite suddenly,\xe2\x80\x9d Pulcheria Alexandrovna answered\r\nhurriedly, encouraged by his curiosity. \xe2\x80\x9cOn the very day I was sending\r\nyou that letter! Would you believe it, that awful man seems to have been\r\nthe cause of her death. They say he beat her dreadfully.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, were they on such bad terms?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, addressing his sister.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all. Quite the contrary indeed. With her, he was always very\r\npatient, considerate even. In fact, all those seven years of their\r\nmarried life he gave way to her, too much so indeed, in many cases. All\r\nof a sudden he seems to have lost patience.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen he could not have been so awful if he controlled himself for seven\r\nyears? You seem to be defending him, Dounia?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, he\xe2\x80\x99s an awful man! I can imagine nothing more awful!\xe2\x80\x9d Dounia\r\nanswered, almost with a shudder, knitting her brows, and sinking into\r\nthought.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat had happened in the morning,\xe2\x80\x9d Pulcheria Alexandrovna went on\r\nhurriedly. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd directly afterwards she ordered the horses to be\r\nharnessed to drive to the town immediately after dinner. She always used\r\nto drive to the town in such cases. She ate a very good dinner, I am\r\ntold....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter the beating?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was always her... habit; and immediately after dinner, so as not\r\nto be late in starting, she went to the bath-house.... You see, she was\r\nundergoing some treatment with baths. They have a cold spring there, and\r\nshe used to bathe in it regularly every day, and no sooner had she got\r\ninto the water when she suddenly had a stroke!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should think so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Zossimov.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd did he beat her badly?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does that matter!\xe2\x80\x9d put in Dounia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cH\xe2\x80\x99m! But I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why you want to tell us such gossip, mother,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said Raskolnikov irritably, as it were in spite of himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, my dear, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to talk about,\xe2\x80\x9d broke from Pulcheria\r\nAlexandrovna.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, are you all afraid of me?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, with a constrained smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s certainly true,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dounia, looking directly and sternly at\r\nher brother. \xe2\x80\x9cMother was crossing herself with terror as she came up the\r\nstairs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis face worked, as though in convulsion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAch, what are you saying, Dounia! Don\xe2\x80\x99t be angry, please, Rodya....\r\nWhy did you say that, Dounia?\xe2\x80\x9d Pulcheria Alexandrovna began,\r\noverwhelmed--\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, coming here, I was dreaming all the way, in the\r\ntrain, how we should meet, how we should talk over everything\r\ntogether.... And I was so happy, I did not notice the journey! But what\r\nam I saying? I am happy now.... You should not, Dounia.... I am happy\r\nnow--simply in seeing you, Rodya....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush, mother,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered in confusion, not looking at her, but\r\npressing her hand. \xe2\x80\x9cWe shall have time to speak freely of everything!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he said this, he was suddenly overwhelmed with confusion and turned\r\npale. Again that awful sensation he had known of late passed with deadly\r\nchill over his soul. Again it became suddenly plain and perceptible to\r\nhim that he had just told a fearful lie--that he would never now be\r\nable to speak freely of everything--that he would never again be able to\r\n_speak_ of anything to anyone. The anguish of this thought was such that\r\nfor a moment he almost forgot himself. He got up from his seat, and not\r\nlooking at anyone walked towards the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you about?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Razumihin, clutching him by the arm.\r\n\r\nHe sat down again, and began looking about him, in silence. They were\r\nall looking at him in perplexity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what are you all so dull for?\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted, suddenly and quite\r\nunexpectedly. \xe2\x80\x9cDo say something! What\xe2\x80\x99s the use of sitting like this?\r\nCome, do speak. Let us talk.... We meet together and sit in silence....\r\nCome, anything!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank God; I was afraid the same thing as yesterday was beginning\r\nagain,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pulcheria Alexandrovna, crossing herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter, Rodya?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Avdotya Romanovna, distrustfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, nothing! I remembered something,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, and suddenly\r\nlaughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if you remembered something; that\xe2\x80\x99s all right!... I was beginning\r\nto think...\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Zossimov, getting up from the sofa. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is time\r\nfor me to be off. I will look in again perhaps... if I can...\xe2\x80\x9d He made\r\nhis bows, and went out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat an excellent man!\xe2\x80\x9d observed Pulcheria Alexandrovna.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, excellent, splendid, well-educated, intelligent,\xe2\x80\x9d Raskolnikov\r\nbegan, suddenly speaking with surprising rapidity, and a liveliness he\r\nhad not shown till then. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t remember where I met him before my\r\nillness.... I believe I have met him somewhere----... And this is a good\r\nman, too,\xe2\x80\x9d he nodded at Razumihin. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you like him, Dounia?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked\r\nher; and suddenly, for some unknown reason, laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery much,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Dounia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFoo!--what a pig you are!\xe2\x80\x9d Razumihin protested, blushing in terrible\r\nconfusion, and he got up from his chair. Pulcheria Alexandrovna smiled\r\nfaintly, but Raskolnikov laughed aloud.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you off to?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou need not at all. Stay. Zossimov has gone, so you must. Don\xe2\x80\x99t go.\r\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the time? Is it twelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock? What a pretty watch you have got,\r\nDounia. But why are you all silent again? I do all the talking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was a present from Marfa Petrovna,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Dounia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd a very expensive one!\xe2\x80\x9d added Pulcheria Alexandrovna.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA-ah! What a big one! Hardly like a lady\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like that sort,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dounia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo it is not a present from her _fianc\xc3\xa9_,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Razumihin, and was\r\nunreasonably delighted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought it was Luzhin\xe2\x80\x99s present,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Raskolnikov.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, he has not made Dounia any presents yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA-ah! And do you remember, mother, I was in love and wanted to get\r\nmarried?\xe2\x80\x9d he said suddenly, looking at his mother, who was disconcerted\r\nby the sudden change of subject and the way he spoke of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, my dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPulcheria Alexandrovna exchanged glances with Dounia and Razumihin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cH\xe2\x80\x99m, yes. What shall I tell you? I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember much indeed. She was\r\nsuch a sickly girl,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, growing dreamy and looking down again.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite an invalid. She was fond of giving alms to the poor, and was\r\nalways dreaming of a nunnery, and once she burst into tears when she\r\nbegan talking to me about it. Yes, yes, I remember. I remember very\r\nwell. She was an ugly little thing. I really don\xe2\x80\x99t know what drew me\r\nto her then--I think it was because she was always ill. If she had been\r\nlame or hunchback, I believe I should have liked her better still,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsmiled dreamily. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, it was a sort of spring delirium.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it was not only spring delirium,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dounia, with warm feeling.\r\n\r\nHe fixed a strained intent look on his sister, but did not hear or did\r\nnot understand her words. Then, completely lost in thought, he got up,\r\nwent up to his mother, kissed her, went back to his place and sat down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou love her even now?\xe2\x80\x9d said Pulcheria Alexandrovna, touched.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer? Now? Oh, yes.... You ask about her? No... that\xe2\x80\x99s all now, as\r\nit were, in another world... and so long ago. And indeed everything\r\nhappening here seems somehow far away.\xe2\x80\x9d He looked attentively at them.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou, now... I seem to be looking at you from a thousand miles away...\r\nbut, goodness knows why we are talking of that! And what\xe2\x80\x99s the use of\r\nasking about it?\xe2\x80\x9d he added with annoyance, and biting his nails, fell\r\ninto dreamy silence again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a wretched lodging you have, Rodya! It\xe2\x80\x99s like a tomb,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nPulcheria Alexandrovna, suddenly breaking the oppressive silence. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nam sure it\xe2\x80\x99s quite half through your lodging you have become so\r\nmelancholy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy lodging,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, listlessly. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, the lodging had a great\r\ndeal to do with it.... I thought that, too.... If only you knew, though,\r\nwhat a strange thing you said just now, mother,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, laughing\r\nstrangely.\r\n\r\nA little more, and their companionship, this mother and this sister,\r\nwith him after three years\xe2\x80\x99 absence, this intimate tone of conversation,\r\nin face of the utter impossibility of really speaking about anything,\r\nwould have been beyond his power of endurance. But there was one urgent\r\nmatter which must be settled one way or the other that day--so he had\r\ndecided when he woke. Now he was glad to remember it, as a means of\r\nescape.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen, Dounia,\xe2\x80\x9d he began, gravely and drily, \xe2\x80\x9cof course I beg your\r\npardon for yesterday, but I consider it my duty to tell you again that\r\nI do not withdraw from my chief point. It is me or Luzhin. If I am a\r\nscoundrel, you must not be. One is enough. If you marry Luzhin, I cease\r\nat once to look on you as a sister.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRodya, Rodya! It is the same as yesterday again,\xe2\x80\x9d Pulcheria\r\nAlexandrovna cried, mournfully. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd why do you call yourself a\r\nscoundrel? I can\xe2\x80\x99t bear it. You said the same yesterday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBrother,\xe2\x80\x9d Dounia answered firmly and with the same dryness. \xe2\x80\x9cIn all\r\nthis there is a mistake on your part. I thought it over at night,\r\nand found out the mistake. It is all because you seem to fancy I am\r\nsacrificing myself to someone and for someone. That is not the case at\r\nall. I am simply marrying for my own sake, because things are hard for\r\nme. Though, of course, I shall be glad if I succeed in being useful to\r\nmy family. But that is not the chief motive for my decision....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is lying,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought to himself, biting his nails vindictively.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cProud creature! She won\xe2\x80\x99t admit she wants to do it out of charity! Too\r\nhaughty! Oh, base characters! They even love as though they hate.... Oh,\r\nhow I... hate them all!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn fact,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Dounia, \xe2\x80\x9cI am marrying Pyotr Petrovitch because of\r\ntwo evils I choose the less. I intend to do honestly all he expects of\r\nme, so I am not deceiving him.... Why did you smile just now?\xe2\x80\x9d She, too,\r\nflushed, and there was a gleam of anger in her eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, with a malignant grin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWithin certain limits. Both the manner and form of Pyotr Petrovitch\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncourtship showed me at once what he wanted. He may, of course, think too\r\nwell of himself, but I hope he esteems me, too.... Why are you laughing\r\nagain?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd why are you blushing again? You are lying, sister. You are\r\nintentionally lying, simply from feminine obstinacy, simply to hold your\r\nown against me.... You cannot respect Luzhin. I have seen him and talked\r\nwith him. So you are selling yourself for money, and so in any case you\r\nare acting basely, and I am glad at least that you can blush for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not true. I am not lying,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Dounia, losing her composure.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would not marry him if I were not convinced that he esteems me\r\nand thinks highly of me. I would not marry him if I were not firmly\r\nconvinced that I can respect him. Fortunately, I can have convincing\r\nproof of it this very day... and such a marriage is not a vileness, as\r\nyou say! And even if you were right, if I really had determined on a\r\nvile action, is it not merciless on your part to speak to me like that?\r\nWhy do you demand of me a heroism that perhaps you have not either? It\r\nis despotism; it is tyranny. If I ruin anyone, it is only myself.... I\r\nam not committing a murder. Why do you look at me like that? Why are you\r\nso pale? Rodya, darling, what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood heavens! You have made him faint,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, nonsense! It\xe2\x80\x99s nothing. A little giddiness--not fainting. You\r\nhave fainting on the brain. H\xe2\x80\x99m, yes, what was I saying? Oh, yes. In\r\nwhat way will you get convincing proof to-day that you can respect him,\r\nand that he... esteems you, as you said. I think you said to-day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMother, show Rodya Pyotr Petrovitch\xe2\x80\x99s letter,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dounia.\r\n\r\nWith trembling hands, Pulcheria Alexandrovna gave him the letter. He\r\ntook it with great interest, but, before opening it, he suddenly looked\r\nwith a sort of wonder at Dounia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is strange,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, slowly, as though struck by a new idea. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\nam I making such a fuss for? What is it all about? Marry whom you like!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe said this as though to himself, but said it aloud, and looked for\r\nsome time at his sister, as though puzzled. He opened the letter at\r\nlast, still with the same look of strange wonder on his face. Then,\r\nslowly and attentively, he began reading, and read it through twice.\r\nPulcheria Alexandrovna showed marked anxiety, and all indeed expected\r\nsomething particular.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat surprises me,\xe2\x80\x9d he began, after a short pause, handing the letter\r\nto his mother, but not addressing anyone in particular, \xe2\x80\x9cis that he is a\r\nbusiness man, a lawyer, and his conversation is pretentious indeed, and\r\nyet he writes such an uneducated letter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey all started. They had expected something quite different.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut they all write like that, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d Razumihin observed, abruptly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you read it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe showed him, Rodya. We... consulted him just now,\xe2\x80\x9d Pulcheria\r\nAlexandrovna began, embarrassed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s just the jargon of the courts,\xe2\x80\x9d Razumihin put in. \xe2\x80\x9cLegal\r\ndocuments are written like that to this day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLegal? Yes, it\xe2\x80\x99s just legal--business language--not so very uneducated,\r\nand not quite educated--business language!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPyotr Petrovitch makes no secret of the fact that he had a cheap\r\neducation, he is proud indeed of having made his own way,\xe2\x80\x9d Avdotya\r\nRomanovna observed, somewhat offended by her brother\xe2\x80\x99s tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if he\xe2\x80\x99s proud of it, he has reason, I don\xe2\x80\x99t deny it. You seem to\r\nbe offended, sister, at my making only such a frivolous criticism on the\r\nletter, and to think that I speak of such trifling matters on purpose to\r\nannoy you. It is quite the contrary, an observation apropos of the style\r\noccurred to me that is by no means irrelevant as things stand. There\r\nis one expression, \xe2\x80\x98blame yourselves\xe2\x80\x99 put in very significantly and\r\nplainly, and there is besides a threat that he will go away at once if I\r\nam present. That threat to go away is equivalent to a threat to abandon\r\nyou both if you are disobedient, and to abandon you now after summoning\r\nyou to Petersburg. Well, what do you think? Can one resent such an\r\nexpression from Luzhin, as we should if he (he pointed to Razumihin) had\r\nwritten it, or Zossimov, or one of us?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cN-no,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Dounia, with more animation. \xe2\x80\x9cI saw clearly that it\r\nwas too na\xc3\xafvely expressed, and that perhaps he simply has no skill\r\nin writing... that is a true criticism, brother. I did not expect,\r\nindeed...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is expressed in legal style, and sounds coarser than perhaps he\r\nintended. But I must disillusion you a little. There is one expression\r\nin the letter, one slander about me, and rather a contemptible one. I\r\ngave the money last night to the widow, a woman in consumption, crushed\r\nwith trouble, and not \xe2\x80\x98on the pretext of the funeral,\xe2\x80\x99 but simply to pay\r\nfor the funeral, and not to the daughter--a young woman, as he writes,\r\nof notorious behaviour (whom I saw last night for the first time in my\r\nlife)--but to the widow. In all this I see a too hasty desire to slander\r\nme and to raise dissension between us. It is expressed again in legal\r\njargon, that is to say, with a too obvious display of the aim, and\r\nwith a very na\xc3\xafve eagerness. He is a man of intelligence, but to act\r\nsensibly, intelligence is not enough. It all shows the man and... I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t think he has a great esteem for you. I tell you this simply to\r\nwarn you, because I sincerely wish for your good...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDounia did not reply. Her resolution had been taken. She was only\r\nawaiting the evening.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen what is your decision, Rodya?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Pulcheria Alexandrovna, who\r\nwas more uneasy than ever at the sudden, new businesslike tone of his\r\ntalk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat decision?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see Pyotr Petrovitch writes that you are not to be with us this\r\nevening, and that he will go away if you come. So will you... come?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat, of course, is not for me to decide, but for you first, if you are\r\nnot offended by such a request; and secondly, by Dounia, if she, too, is\r\nnot offended. I will do what you think best,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, drily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDounia has already decided, and I fully agree with her,\xe2\x80\x9d Pulcheria\r\nAlexandrovna hastened to declare.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI decided to ask you, Rodya, to urge you not to fail to be with us at\r\nthis interview,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dounia. \xe2\x80\x9cWill you come?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will ask you, too, to be with us at eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock,\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\r\naddressing Razumihin. \xe2\x80\x9cMother, I am inviting him, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite right, Dounia. Well, since you have decided,\xe2\x80\x9d added Pulcheria\r\nAlexandrovna, \xe2\x80\x9cso be it. I shall feel easier myself. I do not like\r\nconcealment and deception. Better let us have the whole truth.... Pyotr\r\nPetrovitch may be angry or not, now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nAt that moment the door was softly opened, and a young girl walked into\r\nthe room, looking timidly about her. Everyone turned towards her with\r\nsurprise and curiosity. At first sight, Raskolnikov did not recognise\r\nher. It was Sofya Semyonovna Marmeladov. He had seen her yesterday for\r\nthe first time, but at such a moment, in such surroundings and in such\r\na dress, that his memory retained a very different image of her. Now she\r\nwas a modestly and poorly-dressed young girl, very young, indeed,\r\nalmost like a child, with a modest and refined manner, with a candid but\r\nsomewhat frightened-looking face. She was wearing a very plain indoor\r\ndress, and had on a shabby old-fashioned hat, but she still carried a\r\nparasol. Unexpectedly finding the room full of people, she was not so\r\nmuch embarrassed as completely overwhelmed with shyness, like a\r\nlittle child. She was even about to retreat. \xe2\x80\x9cOh... it\xe2\x80\x99s you!\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nRaskolnikov, extremely astonished, and he, too, was confused. He at once\r\nrecollected that his mother and sister knew through Luzhin\xe2\x80\x99s letter\r\nof \xe2\x80\x9csome young woman of notorious behaviour.\xe2\x80\x9d He had only just been\r\nprotesting against Luzhin\xe2\x80\x99s calumny and declaring that he had seen the\r\ngirl last night for the first time, and suddenly she had walked in. He\r\nremembered, too, that he had not protested against the expression \xe2\x80\x9cof\r\nnotorious behaviour.\xe2\x80\x9d All this passed vaguely and fleetingly through\r\nhis brain, but looking at her more intently, he saw that the humiliated\r\ncreature was so humiliated that he felt suddenly sorry for her. When she\r\nmade a movement to retreat in terror, it sent a pang to his heart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not expect you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, hurriedly, with a look that made her\r\nstop. \xe2\x80\x9cPlease sit down. You come, no doubt, from Katerina Ivanovna.\r\nAllow me--not there. Sit here....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt Sonia\xe2\x80\x99s entrance, Razumihin, who had been sitting on one of\r\nRaskolnikov\xe2\x80\x99s three chairs, close to the door, got up to allow her to\r\nenter. Raskolnikov had at first shown her the place on the sofa where\r\nZossimov had been sitting, but feeling that the sofa which served him\r\nas a bed, was too _familiar_ a place, he hurriedly motioned her to\r\nRazumihin\xe2\x80\x99s chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou sit here,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Razumihin, putting him on the sofa.\r\n\r\nSonia sat down, almost shaking with terror, and looked timidly at the\r\ntwo ladies. It was evidently almost inconceivable to herself that she\r\ncould sit down beside them. At the thought of it, she was so frightened\r\nthat she hurriedly got up again, and in utter confusion addressed\r\nRaskolnikov.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI... I... have come for one minute. Forgive me for disturbing you,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nbegan falteringly. \xe2\x80\x9cI come from Katerina Ivanovna, and she had no one to\r\nsend. Katerina Ivanovna told me to beg you... to be at the service... in\r\nthe morning... at Mitrofanievsky... and then... to us... to her...\r\nto do her the honour... she told me to beg you...\xe2\x80\x9d Sonia stammered and\r\nceased speaking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will try, certainly, most certainly,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Raskolnikov. He,\r\ntoo, stood up, and he, too, faltered and could not finish his sentence.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease sit down,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, suddenly. \xe2\x80\x9cI want to talk to you. You are\r\nperhaps in a hurry, but please, be so kind, spare me two minutes,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nhe drew up a chair for her.\r\n\r\nSonia sat down again, and again timidly she took a hurried, frightened\r\nlook at the two ladies, and dropped her eyes. Raskolnikov\xe2\x80\x99s pale face\r\nflushed, a shudder passed over him, his eyes glowed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMother,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, firmly and insistently, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is Sofya Semyonovna\r\nMarmeladov, the daughter of that unfortunate Mr. Marmeladov, who was run\r\nover yesterday before my eyes, and of whom I was just telling you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPulcheria Alexandrovna glanced at Sonia, and slightly screwed up\r\nher eyes. In spite of her embarrassment before Rodya\xe2\x80\x99s urgent and\r\nchallenging look, she could not deny herself that satisfaction. Dounia\r\ngazed gravely and intently into the poor girl\xe2\x80\x99s face, and scrutinised\r\nher with perplexity. Sonia, hearing herself introduced, tried to raise\r\nher eyes again, but was more embarrassed than ever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wanted to ask you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Raskolnikov, hastily, \xe2\x80\x9chow things were\r\narranged yesterday. You were not worried by the police, for instance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, that was all right... it was too evident, the cause of death...\r\nthey did not worry us... only the lodgers are angry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the body\xe2\x80\x99s remaining so long. You see it is hot now. So that,\r\nto-day, they will carry it to the cemetery, into the chapel, until\r\nto-morrow. At first Katerina Ivanovna was unwilling, but now she sees\r\nherself that it\xe2\x80\x99s necessary...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-day, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe begs you to do us the honour to be in the church to-morrow for the\r\nservice, and then to be present at the funeral lunch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is giving a funeral lunch?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes... just a little.... She told me to thank you very much for helping\r\nus yesterday. But for you, we should have had nothing for the funeral.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll at once her lips and chin began trembling, but, with an effort, she\r\ncontrolled herself, looking down again.\r\n\r\nDuring the conversation, Raskolnikov watched her carefully. She had a\r\nthin, very thin, pale little face, rather irregular and angular, with a\r\nsharp little nose and chin. She could not have been called pretty, but\r\nher blue eyes were so clear, and when they lighted up, there was such\r\na kindliness and simplicity in her expression that one could not help\r\nbeing attracted. Her face, and her whole figure indeed, had another\r\npeculiar characteristic. In spite of her eighteen years, she looked\r\nalmost a little girl--almost a child. And in some of her gestures, this\r\nchildishness seemed almost absurd.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut has Katerina Ivanovna been able to manage with such small means?\r\nDoes she even mean to have a funeral lunch?\xe2\x80\x9d Raskolnikov asked,\r\npersistently keeping up the conversation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe coffin will be plain, of course... and everything will be plain, so\r\nit won\xe2\x80\x99t cost much. Katerina Ivanovna and I have reckoned it all out, so\r\nthat there will be enough left... and Katerina Ivanovna was very anxious\r\nit should be so. You know one can\xe2\x80\x99t... it\xe2\x80\x99s a comfort to her... she is\r\nlike that, you know....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understand, I understand... of course... why do you look at my room\r\nlike that? My mother has just said it is like a tomb.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou gave us everything yesterday,\xe2\x80\x9d Sonia said suddenly, in reply, in a\r\nloud rapid whisper; and again she looked down in confusion. Her lips\r\nand chin were trembling once more. She had been struck at once\r\nby Raskolnikov\xe2\x80\x99s poor surroundings, and now these words broke out\r\nspontaneously. A silence followed. There was a light in Dounia\xe2\x80\x99s eyes,\r\nand even Pulcheria Alexandrovna looked kindly at Sonia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRodya,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, getting up, \xe2\x80\x9cwe shall have dinner together, of\r\ncourse. Come, Dounia.... And you, Rodya, had better go for a little\r\nwalk, and then rest and lie down before you come to see us.... I am\r\nafraid we have exhausted you....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, I\xe2\x80\x99ll come,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, getting up fussily. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I have\r\nsomething to see to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut surely you will have dinner together?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Razumihin, looking in\r\nsurprise at Raskolnikov. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, I am coming... of course, of course! And you stay a minute.\r\nYou do not want him just now, do you, mother? Or perhaps I am taking him\r\nfrom you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, no. And will you, Dmitri Prokofitch, do us the favour of dining\r\nwith us?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease do,\xe2\x80\x9d added Dounia.\r\n\r\nRazumihin bowed, positively radiant. For one moment, they were all\r\nstrangely embarrassed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye, Rodya, that is till we meet. I do not like saying good-bye.\r\nGood-bye, Nastasya. Ah, I have said good-bye again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPulcheria Alexandrovna meant to greet Sonia, too; but it somehow failed\r\nto come off, and she went in a flutter out of the room.\r\n\r\nBut Avdotya Romanovna seemed to await her turn, and following her mother\r\nout, gave Sonia an attentive, courteous bow. Sonia, in confusion, gave\r\na hurried, frightened curtsy. There was a look of poignant discomfort\r\nin her face, as though Avdotya Romanovna\xe2\x80\x99s courtesy and attention were\r\noppressive and painful to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDounia, good-bye,\xe2\x80\x9d called Raskolnikov, in the passage. \xe2\x80\x9cGive me your\r\nhand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I did give it to you. Have you forgotten?\xe2\x80\x9d said Dounia, turning\r\nwarmly and awkwardly to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind, give it to me again.\xe2\x80\x9d And he squeezed her fingers warmly.\r\n\r\nDounia smiled, flushed, pulled her hand away, and went off quite happy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, that\xe2\x80\x99s capital,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Sonia, going back and looking\r\nbrightly at her. \xe2\x80\x9cGod give peace to the dead, the living have still to\r\nlive. That is right, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSonia looked surprised at the sudden brightness of his face. He looked\r\nat her for some moments in silence. The whole history of the dead father\r\nfloated before his memory in those moments....\r\n\r\n**
